## Using Orchestration and Hooks

### Automatic Orchestration

```bash
# Automatic scenario selection for desktop app
./.claude/hooks/orchestration-trigger.sh

# Or specific scenario selection:
./.claude/hooks/orchestration-trigger.sh "$(pwd)" "desktop"

# Orchestration progress monitoring
./.claude/hooks/orchestration-monitor.sh "watch"
```

**Expected Orchestration Behavior:**
1. **Automatic Scenario Detection:** System detects desktop app Python/SQLite
2. **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Automatic coordination business-analyst → architect → frontend-engineer → qa-engineer
3. **Phase Gates:** Validation between phases with approval points
4. **Conflict Resolution:** Automatic handling conflicts between GUI design and database schema

### Using Hooks

#### Performance Monitoring

```bash
# GUI development performance monitoring
./.claude/hooks/agent-performance-monitor.sh "start" "frontend-engineer"

# Desktop development bottleneck checking
./.claude/hooks/agent-performance-monitor.sh "analyze" "desktop"
```

#### Dependency Tracking

```bash
# Dependency validation before desktop development
./.claude/hooks/cross-agent-dependency-tracker.sh "validate" "frontend-engineer"

# Packaging readiness check
./.claude/hooks/cross-agent-dependency-tracker.sh "check" "deployment-engineer"
```

#### Quality Assurance

```bash
# Desktop application standards compliance check
./.claude/hooks/compliance-automation.sh "desktop" "frontend-engineer"

# Accessibility validation for long-term use
./.claude/hooks/compliance-automation.sh "accessibility" "design"
```

## TODO Workflow Management Example

### Hierarchical TODO Configuration for Desktop App

Based on CLAUDE.md Section 8 configuration for **publishing** domain and **sme** scale:

```yaml
## 8. TODO Management Configuration
### Task Management Strategy
- **todo_management_enabled**: true
- **todo_hierarchy_level**: hierarchical
- **auto_task_creation**: true
- **project_scale**: sme
- **business_domain**: publishing

### Agent TODO Responsibilities
- **Epic Level (business-analyst)**: User story epics, stakeholder requirements
- **Feature Level (product-manager)**: Feature specifications, MVP planning
- **Task Level (software-architect)**: Technical architecture, component design
- **Subtask Level (implementation agents)**: Concrete development tasks
```

### Real TODO Workflow Examples

#### Phase 1: Business Analysis TODO Flow

**business-analyst** creates Epic-level TODOs:

```javascript
// TodoWrite command from business-analyst
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "Define target user personas for book writing application",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Defining target user personas"
    },
    {
      content: "Analyze competitor features (Scrivener, yWriter, Ulysses)",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Analyzing competitor features"
    },
    {
      content: "Create user journey maps for complete writing workflow",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Creating user journey maps"
    }
  ]
})
```

**Handoff to product-manager** with Epic completion and Feature breakdown:

```javascript
// business-analyst completes Epic, hands off to product-manager
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "Define target user personas for book writing application",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Defining target user personas"
    },
    {
      content: "Create MVP feature specification from user personas",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Creating MVP feature specification"
    },
    {
      content: "Design three-module architecture (Editor, Library, Publisher Comm)",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Designing modular architecture"
    }
  ]
})
```

#### Phase 3: Development TODO Flow

**software-architect** creates Task-level breakdown:

```javascript
// software-architect breaks down Feature into Tasks
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "Design wxPython main window architecture with panel system",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Designing main window architecture"
    },
    {
      content: "Create SQLite database schema for books, chapters, sources",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Creating database schema"
    },
    {
      content: "Implement text editor component with advanced features",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Implementing text editor"
    },
    {
      content: "Design export system architecture (PDF, EPUB, DOCX)",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Designing export system"
    }
  ]
})
```

**frontend-engineer** executes Subtasks:

```javascript
// frontend-engineer handles concrete implementation
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "Implement wxPython MainFrame with menu system",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Implementing MainFrame"
    },
    {
      content: "Create text editor panel with syntax highlighting",
      status: "completed",
      activeForm: "Creating text editor panel"
    },
    {
      content: "Implement source library panel with tree control",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Implementing source library panel"
    },
    {
      content: "Add keyboard shortcuts and writer-friendly UX",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Adding keyboard shortcuts"
    },
    {
      content: "Integrate with SQLAlchemy models for data persistence",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Integrating data persistence"
    }
  ]
})
```

#### Cross-Agent Coordination Example

When **qa-engineer** identifies issues, coordination happens via TODO updates:

```javascript
// qa-engineer creates testing TODOs with dependencies
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "Fix text editor memory leak with large documents",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Fixing memory leak"
    },
    {
      content: "Add unit tests for SQLAlchemy book model operations",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Adding book model tests"
    },
    {
      content: "Implement E2E tests for complete book writing workflow",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Implementing E2E tests"
    }
  ]
})

// frontend-engineer responds to bug fix TODO
// (memory leak fix completed, hands back to qa-engineer)
```

### Production Automation Example

Using `.claude/templates/todo/agent-coordination-hooks.sh`:

```bash
# Automatic TODO mapping for desktop application
./claude/templates/todo/agent-coordination-hooks.sh book-writing-studio desktop-app

# Expected output:
