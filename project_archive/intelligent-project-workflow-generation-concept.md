```bash
Primary Responsibilities:
- Project characteristic analysis and classification
- Workflow template selection and customization
- Agent sequence optimization based on dependencies
- Quality gate placement and validation checkpoint creation
- Dynamic workflow adaptation based on project progress

Workflow Generation Process:
1. Project analysis (extends existing project_detector.sh)
2. Workflow template matching (based on project characteristics)
3. Agent sequence optimization (intelligent dependency resolution)
4. Quality gate placement (risk-based validation checkpoints)
5. Workflow validation and output generation
6. Progress monitoring and adaptive refinement
```

#### **2. workflow_analyzer.sh - Project Intelligence System**
```bash
Analysis Capabilities:
- Deep project structure analysis (beyond basic technology detection)
- Complexity assessment (codebase size, architectural patterns, dependencies)
- Risk profiling (legacy code, security requirements, compliance needs)
- Team characteristics (size, experience level, geographic distribution)
- Business constraints (deadlines, budget, regulatory requirements)
- Historical pattern matching (similar project outcomes and optimizations)
```

#### **3. agent_optimizer.sh - Intelligent Agent Selection**
```bash
Optimization Engine:
- Agent capability mapping to project requirements
- Workload distribution optimization across agent specializations
- Parallel vs sequential task identification and scheduling
- Agent collaboration pattern optimization
- Resource utilization analysis and bottleneck prevention
- Dynamic agent scaling based on project complexity
```

#### **4. workflow_templates/ - Dynamic Workflow Library**
```bash
Template Categories:
- Technology-specific workflows (React+Node, Angular+Java, Python+Django)
- Domain-specific workflows (FinTech compliance, Healthcare HIPAA, E-commerce)
- Scale-specific workflows (Startup MVP, SME production, Enterprise deployment)
- Methodology-specific workflows (Agile/Scrum, Waterfall, DevOps, TDD)
- Hybrid workflows (combinations of above for complex requirements)

Template Structure:
- Phase definitions with entry/exit criteria
- Agent sequences with dependency mappings
- Quality gates with validation requirements
- Milestone definitions with success metrics
- Risk mitigation strategies and fallback procedures
```
