    if learning_enabled:
        adaptive_recs = get_adaptive_recommendations(context)

        # Dynamic weight adjustment based on learning quality
        if alignment_rate > 75% and interactions > 10:
            universal_weight = 0.54  # Reduced (0.6 * 0.9)
            adaptive_weight = 0.52   # Boosted (0.4 * 1.3)
        else:
            universal_weight = 0.6
            adaptive_weight = 0.4

        # Combine with bonuses for multi-source recommendations
        combined_score = (universal_score * universal_weight +
                         adaptive_score * adaptive_weight)

        if both_systems_recommend:
            combined_score *= 1.15  # 15% bonus
