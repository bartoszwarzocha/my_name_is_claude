        recommendations = {}
        for model_name, model in self.ensemble_models.items():
            recommendations[model_name] = model.predict_proba(features)

        # Ensemble combination with weighted voting
        final_recommendations = self._ensemble_combine(recommendations)

        # Add explainability and confidence scores
        return self._add_explainability(final_recommendations, project_context)

    def _ensemble_combine(self, recommendations: Dict) -> np.ndarray:
        """Combine multiple model predictions with weighted voting"""
        weights = {
            'random_forest': 0.4,    # Good for feature importance
            'neural_network': 0.4,   # Good for complex patterns
            'rule_based': 0.2,       # Good for business logic
        }

        combined = np.zeros_like(recommendations['random_forest'])
