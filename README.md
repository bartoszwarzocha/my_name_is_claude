### 🔧 TODO Management System

The framework provides multi-level TODO management combining Claude Code's built-in TodoWrite tool with advanced hierarchical task management. **Configuration is controlled via CLAUDE.md Section 8**.

#### 📋 Configuration-Driven TODO Management

The TODO system is automatically configured based on your `CLAUDE.md` settings:

```yaml
# Example configuration in CLAUDE.md
todo_management_enabled: true
todo_hierarchy_level: hierarchical
auto_task_creation: true
progress_tracking: project
agent_coordination: true
```

**Agents automatically adapt their TODO behavior based on these settings.**

#### 📝 Basic TODO Usage (TodoWrite Tool)

**System Level - Simple Session Tracking:**
```typescript
// Current session tasks via TodoWrite tool
{
  content: "Fix user authentication bug",
  status: "in_progress",
  activeForm: "Fixing user authentication bug"
}
```

**Best practices for TodoWrite:**
- Use for immediate, session-specific tasks
- Mark tasks as in_progress BEFORE starting work
- Complete tasks IMMEDIATELY after finishing
- Only have ONE task in_progress at a time

#### 🏗️ Advanced Hierarchical TODO System

**Framework provides 4-level hierarchical task management:**

```yaml
# Epic Level (4-12 weeks)
Epic: "Complete user authentication system overhaul"
  owners: [business-analyst, product-manager]

  # Feature Level (1-3 weeks)
  ├── Feature: "OAuth2 with multi-factor authentication"
  │     owners: [software-architect, security-engineer]
  │
  │     # Task Level (1-3 days)
  │     ├── Task: "JWT token refresh mechanism"
  │     │     owner: api-engineer
  │     │     estimated: 8 hours
  │     │
  │     │     # Subtask Level (2-8 hours)
  │     │     ├── Subtask: "Unit tests for token validation"
  │     │     └── Subtask: "Integration with refresh endpoint"
  │     │
  │     └── Task: "Multi-factor authentication UI"
  │           owner: frontend-engineer
  │
  └── Feature: "Session management dashboard"
        owners: [ux-designer, frontend-engineer]
```

### 📋 How to Configure and Use TODO System

#### 🔧 **Step 1: Configure in CLAUDE.md**

Set your TODO management preferences in `CLAUDE.md` Section 8:

**For Simple Projects:**
```yaml
todo_management_enabled: true
todo_hierarchy_level: simple
session_todos: true
agent_coordination: true
```

**For Complex Projects:**
```yaml
todo_management_enabled: true
todo_hierarchy_level: hierarchical
auto_task_creation: true
epic_management: true
feature_breakdown: true
task_granularity: detailed
```

#### 📱 **Step 2: Agents Read Configuration Automatically**

When agents start work, they automatically:
1. Read your CLAUDE.md TODO configuration
2. Adapt their task management behavior
3. Use appropriate TODO level (Session/Feature/Epic)
4. Coordinate with other agents based on settings

#### 1. **Simple Project Implementation**

For straightforward projects with `todo_hierarchy_level: simple`:

```bash
# Start development session
claude-code

# Agents automatically use TodoWrite based on CLAUDE.md:
# - "Implement login form" (frontend-engineer)
# - "Add validation logic" (api-engineer)
# - "Write unit tests" (qa-engineer)
# - "Update documentation" (reviewer)
```

#### 2. **Complex Project Implementation**

For enterprise projects with `todo_hierarchy_level: hierarchical` and `epic_management: true`:

```bash
# 1. Business Analyst automatically creates Epic based on CLAUDE.md
business-analyst automatically creates:
Epic: "E-commerce checkout system" (reads: epic_management: true)

# 2. Architecture agents break into Features (reads: feature_breakdown: true)
software-architect automatically creates:
├── Feature: "Payment processing integration"
├── Feature: "Order confirmation workflow"
└── Feature: "Inventory management sync"

# 3. Implementation agents create Tasks (reads: auto_task_creation: true)
api-engineer automatically creates:
├── Task: "Stripe API integration" (8 hours)
├── Task: "Email notification system" (4 hours)

# 4. Daily execution uses TodoWrite (reads: session_todos: true)
All agents coordinate via TodoWrite for immediate tasks
```

#### 3. **Automatic Agent-Driven Implementation**

Agents automatically use specialized prompts based on CLAUDE.md configuration:

```bash
# CLAUDE.md configuration drives agent behavior:
todo_management_enabled: true
auto_task_creation: true
agent_coordination: true
epic_owners: [business-analyst, product-manager]

# Agents automatically execute based on configuration:

# Business Analyst (if epic_management: true)
business-analyst:
├── Reads CLAUDE.md: epic_owners includes business-analyst
├── Uses: stakeholder-requirements-gathering.md
├── Creates: Epic definitions with TodoWrite integration
├── Coordinates: With product-manager via agent_coordination

# Product Manager (if feature_breakdown: true)
product-manager:
├── Reads CLAUDE.md: feature_breakdown: true
├── Uses: feature-implementation-from-specification.md
├── Creates: Feature breakdown via hierarchical TODO
├── Hands off: To architecture agents

# Implementation Agents (if auto_task_creation: true)
frontend-engineer, api-engineer:
├── Read CLAUDE.md: auto_task_creation: true
├── Create: Detailed tasks automatically via TodoWrite
├── Coordinate: Based on agent_coordination setting
├── Track: Progress via session_todos: true
```

### 🎯 Practical TODO Examples

#### Example 1: **Desktop Application Development**

```yaml
# Using hierarchical approach
Epic: "Cross-platform book writing application"
├── Feature: "Rich text editor with formatting"
│   ├── Task: "wxPython editor component" (frontend-engineer)
│   └── Task: "Document auto-save system" (data-engineer)
├── Feature: "Export and publishing system"
│   ├── Task: "PDF generation engine" (api-engineer)
│   └── Task: "Cloud sync integration" (deployment-engineer)
```

**Daily execution with TodoWrite:**
```bash
# Frontend engineer's session
TodoWrite: "Create wxPython rich text editor component"
├── Status: in_progress
├── Subtasks handled automatically
└── Complete when component functional
```

#### Example 2: **Web Application Migration**

```yaml
# Strategic planning level
Epic: "Legacy system modernization"
├── Feature: "API reverse engineering"
├── Feature: "Frontend Angular migration"
└── Feature: "Database schema optimization"

# Daily execution level (via TodoWrite)
Today's Tasks:
├── "Analyze legacy API endpoints" (in_progress)
├── "Create Angular component structure" (pending)
└── "Set up automated testing pipeline" (pending)
```

#### Example 3: **Security Implementation**

```yaml
# Hierarchical security planning
Epic: "Enterprise security compliance"
├── Feature: "Authentication & authorization"
│   ├── Task: "OAuth2 implementation"
│   ├── Task: "Role-based access control"
│   └── Task: "Multi-factor authentication"
├── Feature: "Data encryption & privacy"
├── Feature: "Audit logging & monitoring"

# Agent execution with TodoWrite
security-engineer session:
├── "Implement JWT token validation" (completed)
├── "Set up rate limiting middleware" (in_progress)
└── "Configure HTTPS certificates" (pending)
```

### 🔄 TODO Integration Workflow

1. **Project Planning Phase:**
   - Use hierarchical TODO for strategic breakdown
   - Assign features to appropriate agents
   - Estimate timelines and dependencies

2. **Development Execution:**
   - Agents use TodoWrite for session management
   - Track immediate tasks and completion
   - Coordinate between agents using handoff protocols

3. **Progress Tracking:**
   - Hierarchical view for stakeholder reporting
   - TodoWrite for developer productivity
   - Integration points for project management tools

### 🎯 CLAUDE.md Configuration Examples

#### **Startup Configuration (project_scale: startup)**
```yaml
# In CLAUDE.md Section 8:
todo_management_enabled: true
todo_hierarchy_level: simple
session_todos: true
agent_coordination: true
auto_task_creation: true
progress_tracking: session
epic_management: false
feature_breakdown: true
task_granularity: standard
```

**Result:** Agents use TodoWrite for immediate tasks, coordinate between 2-3 agents, focus on speed.

#### **Enterprise Configuration (project_scale: enterprise)**
```yaml
# In CLAUDE.md Section 8:
todo_management_enabled: true
todo_hierarchy_level: hierarchical
session_todos: true
agent_coordination: true
auto_task_creation: true
progress_tracking: enterprise
epic_management: true
feature_breakdown: true
task_granularity: detailed
subtask_tracking: true
daily_standups: true
weekly_summaries: true
burndown_charts: true
external_tools: jira
```

**Result:** Full hierarchical system, 5+ agents coordination, automated reporting, external tool integration.

### 🎯 When to Use Each Configuration

**Use Simple Configuration when:**
- `project_scale: startup`
- Development cycles under 1 week
- Need fast iterations
- 1-3 agents maximum

**Use Hierarchical Configuration when:**
- `project_scale: sme` or `enterprise`
- Projects lasting 4+ weeks
- Need stakeholder reporting
- 5+ specialized agents

**Configuration Drives Agent Behavior:**
- Agents automatically read CLAUDE.md at startup
- TODO behavior adapts to configuration
- No manual prompt editing required
- Consistent behavior across all agents

The framework's TODO system automatically scales from simple session management to enterprise project coordination based on your CLAUDE.md configuration.
