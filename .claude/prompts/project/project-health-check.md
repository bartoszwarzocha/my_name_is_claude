5. **Examine performance characteristics** - Analyze response times, resource utilization, scalability metrics, and bottlenecks

### Phase 2: Security and Compliance Evaluation
1. **Conduct security posture assessment** - Scan for vulnerabilities, evaluate authentication mechanisms, and review access controls
2. **Analyze compliance requirements** - Assess adherence to industry standards, regulatory requirements, and organizational policies
3. **Review data handling practices** - Evaluate data privacy, encryption, retention policies, and cross-border compliance
4. **Assess third-party risk exposure** - Review external service dependencies, vendor security practices, and integration risks
5. **Evaluate incident response readiness** - Check monitoring capabilities, alerting systems, and response procedures

### Phase 3: Business Alignment and Value Assessment
1. **Evaluate business goal alignment** - Assess how well project outcomes support stated business objectives and KPIs
2. **Analyze user satisfaction indicators** - Review user feedback, adoption rates, feature usage patterns, and support tickets
3. **Assess market competitiveness** - Evaluate feature parity, performance benchmarks, and competitive positioning
4. **Review resource utilization efficiency** - Analyze team productivity, budget utilization, and return on investment metrics
5. **Evaluate future sustainability** - Assess scalability plans, technology roadmap alignment, and long-term viability

### Phase 4: Risk Assessment and Recommendation Generation
1. **Identify critical risk factors** - Catalog technical, security, business, and operational risks with impact assessment
2. **Prioritize improvement opportunities** - Rank recommendations by impact, effort, and strategic importance
3. **Generate actionable remediation plans** - Create specific steps to address identified issues and risks
4. **Establish monitoring and tracking** - Define metrics and processes for ongoing health monitoring and improvement tracking
5. **Plan stakeholder communication** - Prepare findings presentation appropriate for different audiences (technical, business, executive)
