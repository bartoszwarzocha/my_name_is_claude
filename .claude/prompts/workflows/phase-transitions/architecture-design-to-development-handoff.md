# Architecture Design to Development Handoff

**Workflow: Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 Transition**
**Purpose: Transfer validated architecture and design specifications to development teams**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

Provide development teams with complete technical specifications, design systems, and implementation guidance to ensure consistent, high-quality code delivery.

## ðŸ“‹ Handoff Process

### Step 1: Architecture Documentation Validation
**software-architect + reviewer** ensure completeness:

**System Architecture Package:**
- âœ… System context and container diagrams
- âœ… Component architecture with interface definitions
- âœ… Technology stack selection with justifications
- âœ… Database design and data model specifications
- âœ… Integration patterns and API specifications
- âœ… Security architecture and access controls
- âœ… Performance requirements and scaling strategies
- âœ… Deployment architecture and infrastructure design

### Step 2: UX Design Package Validation
**ux-designer + reviewer** confirm design completeness:

**Design System Package:**
- âœ… Component library with usage guidelines
- âœ… Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- âœ… Interaction patterns and micro-animations
- âœ… Responsive design breakpoints and layouts
- âœ… Accessibility guidelines and compliance requirements
- âœ… User flow diagrams and wireframes
- âœ… High-fidelity mockups and prototypes
- âœ… Design handoff specifications for developers

### Step 3: Development Team Briefings
