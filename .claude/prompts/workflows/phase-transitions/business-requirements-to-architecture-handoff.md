# Business Requirements to Architecture Handoff and Phase Transition Management

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Ensure complete and accurate transfer of validated business requirements, user needs, and constraints to architecture and design phase through systematic handoff protocols. Establish TodoWrite-managed phase transition coordination between business-analyst, product-manager, and software-architect to maintain context continuity, validate requirement completeness, and ensure seamless project progression from business analysis to technical architecture.
