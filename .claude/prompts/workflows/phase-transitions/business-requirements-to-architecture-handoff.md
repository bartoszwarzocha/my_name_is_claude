# Business Requirements to Architecture Handoff

**Workflow: Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 Transition**
**Purpose: Seamlessly transfer validated business requirements to architecture and design teams**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

Ensure complete and accurate transfer of business requirements, user needs, and constraints to the architecture and design phase, setting the foundation for technical and UX design decisions.

## ðŸ“‹ Handoff Process

### Step 1: Requirements Package Validation
**business-analyst + reviewer** validate completeness:

**Business Requirements Document (BRD):**
- âœ… Functional requirements clearly defined
- âœ… Non-functional requirements specified
- âœ… Success criteria and KPIs documented
- âœ… Stakeholder approval obtained
- âœ… Assumptions and constraints documented

**Process Documentation:**
- âœ… Current state process maps completed
- âœ… Future state process vision defined
- âœ… Gap analysis with improvement opportunities
- âœ… Integration requirements with existing systems
- âœ… Compliance and regulatory requirements

**User Research Insights:**
- âœ… User personas and research findings
- âœ… User journey maps and pain points
- âœ… Accessibility requirements
- âœ… User experience expectations
- âœ… Device and platform preferences

### Step 2: Architecture Team Briefing
**software-architect** receives comprehensive briefing including:

**Technical Context:**
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Performance, security, and scalability needs
- Integration requirements and system constraints
- Compliance and regulatory considerations
- Technology preferences and constraints

**Business Context:**
- Business goals and success criteria
- User personas and target market segments
- Budget constraints and timeline expectations
- Risk tolerance and mitigation preferences
- Future scalability and growth projections

### Step 3: UX Design Team Briefing  
**ux-designer** receives user-focused briefing including:

**User Experience Context:**
- User research findings and personas
- User journey maps and interaction patterns
- Accessibility requirements and guidelines
- Usability goals and success metrics
- Device and platform support requirements

**Design Constraints:**
- Brand guidelines and visual standards
- Technical limitations and capabilities
- Content strategy and information architecture
- Internationalization and localization needs
- Performance expectations for user experience

### Step 4: Security and Data Briefing
**security-engineer + data-engineer** receive specialized briefings:

**Security Requirements:**
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Data protection and privacy needs
- Authentication and authorization requirements
- Security monitoring and incident response needs
- Risk tolerance and mitigation strategies

**Data Requirements:**
- Data sources and integration needs
- Analytics and reporting requirements
- Data quality and governance standards
- Backup and disaster recovery expectations
- Performance requirements for data operations

## âœ… Handoff Success Criteria

### Requirements Clarity
- All functional requirements clearly understood
- Non-functional requirements quantified and agreed upon
- Integration requirements fully documented
- Compliance and regulatory needs confirmed

### Team Alignment
- Architecture team has complete understanding of business context
- UX team has comprehensive user research insights
- Security and data teams understand specialized requirements
- All teams aligned on timeline and success criteria

### Deliverable Validation
- Business Requirements Document reviewed and accepted
- User research findings documented and accessible
- Process documentation complete and validated
- Success criteria and KPIs clearly defined and measurable

## ðŸ“¤ Handoff Deliverables

**From Phase 1 Teams:**
- **Complete Business Requirements Document**
- **User Research Report** with personas and journey maps
- **Current and Future State Process** documentation
- **Stakeholder Analysis** and communication plan
- **Success Metrics Framework** with baseline measurements

**To Phase 2 Teams:**
- **Architecture Requirements Briefing** document
- **UX Design Requirements** and user research package
- **Security and Compliance Requirements** specification
- **Data and Analytics Requirements** documentation
- **Project Context** and timeline overview

## ðŸŽ¯ Risk Mitigation

### Common Handoff Risks
