### Step 2: Integration Coordination Points

**API Contract Management:**
- **Frontend â†” API:** REST/GraphQL contract validation and testing
- **API â†” Data:** Database query optimization and transaction management
- **API â†” Security:** Authentication middleware and authorization validation
- **All Teams â†” QA:** Integration testing and contract validation

**Data Flow Coordination:**
- **Data Pipeline Validation:** Ensure data consistency across systems
- **Analytics Integration:** Coordinate reporting requirements with frontend
- **Security Data Flows:** Validate secure data transmission and storage
- **Performance Monitoring:** Coordinate metrics collection across all systems

**Security Integration:**
- **Authentication Flow:** Coordinate login/logout across frontend and backend
- **Authorization Validation:** Ensure consistent permission checking
- **Security Headers:** Coordinate security policy implementation
- **Monitoring Integration:** Ensure security events are properly logged and monitored

## ðŸ”„ Daily Coordination Processes

### Cross-Team Standup (15 minutes daily)
**Participants:** Lead from each development team + qa-engineer

**Agenda Format:**
1. **Integration blockers** and cross-team dependencies (5 minutes)
2. **API changes** and contract updates requiring coordination (3 minutes)
3. **Testing coordination** and quality gate status (3 minutes)
4. **Deployment coordination** and environment synchronization (2 minutes)
5. **Risk escalation** and support needs (2 minutes)

**Key Questions per Team:**
- **Frontend:** Any API contract changes needed? UI ready for integration testing?
- **API:** Any breaking changes? Performance issues affecting other teams?
- **Data:** Data pipeline changes affecting API or analytics? Performance issues?
- **Security:** Security changes affecting authentication or authorization?
- **QA:** Any integration test failures? Quality gates blocking other teams?

### Weekly Integration Review (60 minutes)
**Participants:** All development team leads + software-architect + reviewer

**Agenda Format:**
1. **Architecture compliance** review and validation (15 minutes)
2. **Integration testing** results and issue resolution (20 minutes)
3. **Performance metrics** review and optimization opportunities (10 minutes)
4. **Security validation** and compliance check (10 minutes)
5. **Next week planning** and dependency coordination (5 minutes)

## ðŸ“Š Coordination Tools and Processes
