# Critical Bug Fix Orchestration

**Workflow Type: Emergency Bug Resolution**
**Purpose: Coordinate rapid response for critical production issues with minimal disruption**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

Execute fast, systematic bug resolution while maintaining code quality and preventing similar issues through coordinated agent collaboration and emergency procedures.

## ðŸ“‹ Bug Severity Classification

```yaml
severity_levels:
  critical:
    description: "Production down, data loss, or security breach"
    response_time: "< 30 minutes"
    escalation: "immediate"
    workflow: "emergency_response"
    
  high:
    description: "Core functionality broken for all users"
    response_time: "< 2 hours"
    escalation: "within_1_hour"
    workflow: "priority_response"
    
  medium:
    description: "Functionality broken for subset of users"
    response_time: "< 24 hours"
    escalation: "within_4_hours"
    workflow: "standard_response"
