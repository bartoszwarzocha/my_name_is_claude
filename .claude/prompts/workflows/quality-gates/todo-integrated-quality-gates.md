# TODO-Integrated Quality Gates

**Workflow Type: Quality Validation with TODO Management**
**Purpose: Ensure quality standards through TODO-based validation checkpoints**

---

## 🎯 Mission

Implement comprehensive quality gates integrated with TODO management system to ensure every phase, feature, and task meets defined quality standards before proceeding to the next stage.

## ✅ TODO-Based Quality Gate Framework

### Quality Gate Integration with TodoWrite

Each quality gate creates specific TODO items that must be completed before proceeding:

```javascript
// Quality gate TODO pattern
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "QUALITY GATE: [Gate Name] - [Specific Requirement]",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Validating [requirement]"
    }
  ]
})
```

### Agent Responsibilities for Quality Gates

| **Agent** | **Quality Gate Focus** | **TODO Validation** |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **qa-engineer** | Testing coverage, performance, functionality | Creates and validates all QA TODOs |
| **security-engineer** | Security compliance, vulnerability assessment | Security-focused TODO validation |
| **reviewer** | Code quality, documentation, process compliance | Overall quality gate coordination |
| **deployment-engineer** | Deployment readiness, infrastructure validation | Deployment and ops TODO validation |

## 📋 Quality Gate Definitions

### Phase 1 Quality Gate: Business Requirements Validation

**Gate Guardian: business-analyst + reviewer**

```javascript
// Phase 1 Quality Gate TODOs
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "QUALITY GATE: Business requirements completeness validation",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Validating requirements completeness"
    },
    {
      content: "QUALITY GATE: Stakeholder approval documentation",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Documenting stakeholder approval"
    },
    {
      content: "QUALITY GATE: Success criteria definition and measurability",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Validating success criteria"
    },
    {
      content: "QUALITY GATE: Compliance and regulatory requirements review",
      status: "pending",

## 🚨 Quality Gate Failure Protocol

### Failed Quality Gate TODO Management

When quality gates fail, specific remediation TODOs are created:

```javascript
// Quality gate failure response
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "QUALITY GATE FAILED: [Specific Failure] - Immediate remediation required",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Remediating quality gate failure"
    },
    {
      content: "Root cause analysis for quality gate failure",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm": "Analyzing failure root cause"
    },
    {
      content: "Process improvement plan to prevent recurrence",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm": "Creating improvement plan"
    },
    {
      content: "Re-validation of failed quality gate",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm": "Re-validating quality gate"
    }
  ]
})
```

### Escalation Protocol

Critical quality gate failures trigger escalation TODOs:

```javascript
// Critical escalation TODO
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "CRITICAL ESCALATION: Quality gate blocking release - immediate attention required",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Escalating critical quality issue"
    },
    {
      content: "Stakeholder notification of release impact",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm": "Notifying stakeholders"
    },
    {
      content: "Emergency response team assembly for critical issue",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm": "Assembling response team"
    }
  ]
})
```

## 📊 Quality Gate Automation

### Automated Quality Gate Validation

Use production automation templates for quality gate validation:

```bash
# Automated quality gate validation
./.claude/templates/todo/claude-md-validation.sh quality-gates

# Expected output:
# 🟢 Phase 1 Quality Gate: PASSED - All business requirements validated
# 🟡 Phase 2 Quality Gate: IN PROGRESS - Security review pending
# 🔴 Phase 3 Quality Gate: FAILED - Code coverage below threshold
# ⏸️ Phase 4 Quality Gate: WAITING - Phase 3 must pass first
```

### Quality Metrics Dashboard Integration

Quality gate TODOs integrate with metrics:

```javascript
// Metrics-driven quality gate validation
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "METRIC VALIDATION: Code coverage target >90% (current: 85%)",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Improving code coverage"
    },
    {
      content: "METRIC VALIDATION: Performance response time <200ms (current: 250ms)",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm": "Optimizing performance"
    },
    {
      content: "METRIC VALIDATION: Security vulnerabilities = 0 (current: 2 medium)",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm": "Fixing security vulnerabilities"
    }
  ]
})
```
