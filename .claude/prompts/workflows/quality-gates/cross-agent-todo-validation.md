# Cross-Agent TODO Validation

**Workflow Type: Multi-Agent Coordination Quality Assurance**
**Purpose: Ensure quality through coordinated TODO management across all agents**

---

## 🎯 Mission

Establish systematic cross-agent TODO validation to ensure quality, completeness, and coordination across all development activities, with automatic quality gate enforcement and escalation protocols.

## ✅ Cross-Agent TODO Validation Framework

### Agent Coordination Matrix

| **Primary Agent** | **Validation Agents** | **TODO Validation Focus** |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| **business-analyst** | product-manager, reviewer | Business requirement completeness, stakeholder approval |
| **product-manager** | business-analyst, ux-designer | Feature prioritization, user story quality |
| **software-architect** | api-engineer, security-engineer | Technical feasibility, integration requirements |
| **api-engineer** | frontend-engineer, data-engineer | API contract completeness, integration readiness |
| **frontend-engineer** | ux-designer, qa-engineer | UI implementation quality, user experience validation |
| **data-engineer** | api-engineer, security-engineer | Data integrity, security compliance |
| **security-engineer** | All agents | Security compliance, vulnerability mitigation |
| **qa-engineer** | All agents | Testing coverage, quality assurance |
| **deployment-engineer** | security-engineer, qa-engineer | Deployment readiness, operational requirements |
| **ux-designer** | frontend-engineer, business-analyst | Design implementation, user requirement alignment |
| **reviewer** | All agents | Overall quality validation, process compliance |

## 📋 Cross-Agent Validation Workflows

### Validation Workflow 1: Business to Technical Handoff

**Participants: business-analyst → product-manager → software-architect**

```javascript
// business-analyst completes requirements, requests validation
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "VALIDATION REQUEST: Business requirements complete - needs product-manager review",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Requesting product manager validation"
    },
    {
      content: "Cross-agent validation: Requirement completeness and feasibility",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Awaiting cross-agent validation"
    }
  ]
})

// product-manager validates and requests technical feasibility
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "VALIDATION RECEIVED: Reviewing business requirements for product alignment",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Reviewing business requirements"
    },
    {
      content: "VALIDATION REQUEST: Requirements validated - needs software-architect technical review",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Requesting architect validation"
    }
  ]
})

// software-architect validates technical feasibility
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "VALIDATION RECEIVED: Reviewing requirements for technical feasibility",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Reviewing technical feasibility"
    },
    {
      content: "VALIDATION COMPLETE: Technical feasibility confirmed - ready for development",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Completing feasibility validation"
    }
  ]
})
```

### Validation Workflow 2: Development Quality Assurance

**Participants: Implementation agents → qa-engineer → security-engineer**

```javascript
// api-engineer requests QA validation
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: API endpoints implemented - requesting QA validation",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Requesting QA validation"
    },
    {
      content: "Cross-agent validation: API functionality and performance testing",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Awaiting QA validation"
    }
  ]
})

// qa-engineer validates and requests security review
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "QA VALIDATION: API testing complete - requesting security review",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Completing API testing"
    },
    {
      content: "SECURITY VALIDATION REQUEST: API security assessment needed",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Requesting security validation"
    }
  ]
})

// security-engineer completes validation chain
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "SECURITY VALIDATION: API security assessment complete - APPROVED",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Completing security assessment"
    },
    {
      content: "CROSS-AGENT VALIDATION COMPLETE: API ready for deployment",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Finalizing validation"
    }
  ]
})
```

## 🚨 Quality Gate Enforcement

### Automatic Quality Gate Triggers

Certain TODO patterns automatically trigger quality gate validation:

```javascript
// Critical TODO patterns that trigger quality gates
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "QUALITY GATE TRIGGER: Database schema changes require multi-agent validation",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Triggering database change validation"
    },
    {
      content: "VALIDATION REQUIRED: data-engineer + api-engineer + security-engineer",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Coordinating multi-agent validation"
    }
  ]
})

// Security-critical changes
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "SECURITY GATE TRIGGER: Authentication changes require security validation",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Triggering security validation"
    },
    {
      content: "MANDATORY VALIDATION: security-engineer + qa-engineer + reviewer",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Coordinating security validation"
    }
  ]
})
```

### Escalation Protocol

Failed validations trigger escalation TODOs:

```javascript
// Validation failure escalation
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "VALIDATION FAILED: Critical issue requires immediate attention - ESCALATED",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Escalating validation failure"
    },
    {
      content: "BLOCKER: Development blocked until validation issue resolved",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Managing development blocker"
    },
    {
      content: "EMERGENCY RESPONSE: Assemble emergency response team",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Assembling emergency response"
    }
  ]
})
```

## 📊 Validation Metrics and Monitoring

### TODO-Based Quality Metrics

Track quality through TODO completion patterns:

```javascript
// Quality metrics tracking TODOs
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "METRIC: Cross-agent validation cycle time - target <2 hours",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Measuring validation cycle time"
    },
    {
      content: "METRIC: Validation failure rate - target <5%",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Measuring validation failure rate"
    },
    {
      content: "METRIC: Multi-agent coordination efficiency - target >90%",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Measuring coordination efficiency"
    }
  ]
})
```

## 🔄 Continuous Validation Loops

### Real-Time Validation Monitoring

```javascript
// Continuous monitoring TODOs
TodoWrite({
  todos: [
    {
      content: "CONTINUOUS MONITORING: Track all agent TODO dependencies",
      status: "in_progress",
      activeForm: "Monitoring TODO dependencies"
    },
    {
      content: "AUTOMATIC VALIDATION: Trigger validations based on TODO patterns",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Automating validation triggers"
    },
    {
      content: "QUALITY DASHBOARD: Real-time cross-agent validation status",
      status: "pending",
      activeForm: "Maintaining quality dashboard"
    }
  ]
})
```

### Validation Automation Hooks

Integration with automation templates:

```bash
# Cross-agent validation automation
./.claude/templates/todo/agent-coordination-hooks.sh validate cross-agent

# Expected validation output:
# ✅ business-analyst → product-manager: VALIDATED
# ✅ product-manager → software-architect: VALIDATED
# ⏳ software-architect → api-engineer: IN PROGRESS
# ⏸️ api-engineer → frontend-engineer: WAITING
# 🚨 security-engineer: VALIDATION FAILURE - immediate attention required
```
