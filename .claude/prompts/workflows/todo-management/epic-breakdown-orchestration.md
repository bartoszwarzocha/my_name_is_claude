## ðŸŽ¯ EXECUTION APPROACH

**Systematic Epic Breakdown Methodology**:
1. **Business-value driven decomposition** - Start with business requirements and user value to ensure technical work aligns with objectives
2. **Progressive refinement strategy** - Begin with high-level Epic scope, then progressively refine into Features, Tasks, and Subtasks
3. **Agent expertise utilization** - Assign breakdown responsibilities based on agent competencies and domain knowledge
4. **Dependency-aware planning** - Identify and plan for dependencies early to minimize blocking issues during execution

**TodoWrite Integration Strategy**:
- **Hierarchical TODO creation** - Use TodoWrite at every level (Epicâ†’Featureâ†’Taskâ†’Subtask) with appropriate agent ownership
- **Progressive status tracking** - Track progress through pendingâ†’in_progressâ†’completed status transitions with meaningful activeForm descriptions
- **Cross-agent coordination** - Use TODO status updates to coordinate handoffs between agents and maintain execution visibility
- **Quality gate integration** - Incorporate validation checkpoints into TODO workflows to ensure quality throughout decomposition

**Quality Assurance and Risk Management**:
- **Sizing validation** - Ensure Epic, Feature, Task, and Subtask sizing follows framework guidelines for agent capacity and delivery timelines
- **Completeness verification** - Validate that decomposition covers all Epic requirements without gaps or overlaps
- **Dependency risk mitigation** - Identify critical dependencies early and plan mitigation strategies for potential blocking issues
- **Stakeholder alignment maintenance** - Regular validation checkpoints ensure decomposition maintains business value alignment throughout process
