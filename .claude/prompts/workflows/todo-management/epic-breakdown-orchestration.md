    max_tasks: 20
    
  task:
    min_duration: "2 hours"
    max_duration: "3 days"
    max_subtasks: 5
    
  auto_split_triggers:
    epic_too_large: "duration > 12 weeks OR features > 8"

      - required_for: "any user-specific features"
      
    api_contracts:
      - blocks: ["frontend_integration", "third_party_integration"]
      - required_for: "any API consumers"
