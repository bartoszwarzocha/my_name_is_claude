# CLAUDE.md Configuration to Development Strategy Converter

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Transform a validated CLAUDE.md configuration into actionable development instructions and strategic roadmap. Generate detailed implementation guidance that enables effective multi-agent coordination, establishes clear success criteria, and provides concrete next steps for project initialization.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Configuration Analysis and Context Extraction
1. **Parse CLAUDE.md configuration** - Extract all metadata, business goals, technology stack, and quality requirements
2. **Identify project characteristics** - Determine scale, domain, complexity, and timeline implications
3. **Map agent requirements** - Analyze which agents are needed and their coordination patterns
4. **Extract business priorities** - Understand success criteria and stakeholder expectations
5. **Assess technical constraints** - Identify technology decisions and their implications

### Phase 2: Strategic Roadmap Planning
1. **Define development phases** - Break project into logical phases based on business priorities
2. **Sequence agent activities** - Plan optimal order of agent involvement and handoffs
3. **Establish milestone criteria** - Define measurable outcomes for each phase
4. **Identify risk mitigation strategies** - Plan for technical and business risks
5. **Create quality gates** - Define checkpoints and validation criteria

### Phase 3: Resource Allocation and Team Coordination
1. **Map agent responsibilities** - Assign specific deliverables to each agent type
2. **Design collaboration patterns** - Plan how agents coordinate and share context
3. **Establish communication protocols** - Define handoff procedures and documentation standards
4. **Plan skill development needs** - Identify training or knowledge gaps to address
5. **Optimize workflow efficiency** - Minimize blockers and maximize parallel work

### Phase 4: Implementation Guidance Generation
1. **Create actionable instructions** - Generate specific next steps for project start
2. **Document success criteria** - Establish measurable goals and validation methods
3. **Prepare monitoring frameworks** - Define progress tracking and quality metrics
4. **Generate templates and standards** - Provide reusable patterns and best practices
5. **Establish feedback loops** - Create mechanisms for continuous improvement
