# Concept-to-CLAUDE.md Configuration Generator

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Generate a complete CLAUDE.md configuration file by analyzing project concept materials in the `init_concept` folder. Transform any format of project documentation (business requirements, technical notes, wireframes, code samples, meeting notes) into a properly structured CLAUDE.md following the framework template. Enable zero-configuration project setup by automatically detecting technology stack, business domain, project scale, and agent requirements.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Concept Material Analysis
1. **Scan init_concept folder** - Read all files (.md, .txt, .docx, images, code samples, etc.)
2. **Extract project identity** - Identify project name, description, and core value proposition
3. **Analyze business domain** - Determine industry sector (ecommerce, fintech, healthcare, etc.)
4. **Assess project scale** - Evaluate complexity level (startup/MVP, SME, enterprise)
5. **Identify stakeholders** - Extract user types, business sponsors, and success criteria

### Phase 2: Technology Stack Detection
1. **Parse technical mentions** - Detect frameworks, languages, databases from documentation
2. **Analyze code samples** - Examine existing code for technology patterns
3. **Evaluate architecture notes** - Extract deployment, integration, and infrastructure requirements
4. **Identify constraints** - Find technology preferences, limitations, or existing system dependencies
5. **Recommend optimal stack** - Balance detected preferences with business requirements and project scale

### Phase 3: Agent Requirements Mapping
1. **Analyze project complexity** - Determine which agents are needed based on scope and requirements
2. **Map development phases** - Sequence agent involvement based on project timeline and dependencies
3. **Configure TODO management** - Set hierarchical complexity based on project scale and team size
4. **Define quality requirements** - Extract performance, security, scalability needs from concepts
5. **Establish integration needs** - Identify external systems, APIs, and data sources

### Phase 4: CLAUDE.md Generation and Validation
1. **Populate CLAUDE_template.md** - Fill all sections with extracted and derived information
2. **Generate project metadata** - Create complete Section 0 with all required fields
3. **Structure business goals** - Convert business requirements into measurable objectives
4. **Define technology sections** - Populate Sections 3 with detected and recommended technologies
5. **Configure agent selection** - Set Section 4 with optimal agent subset for project needs
6. **Validate completeness** - Ensure all template sections are properly filled
7. **Create backup** - Save original CLAUDE.md as CLAUDE_backup_[timestamp].md before replacement

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Concept Analysis Completeness
- **All concept files processed**: Every file in init_concept folder has been analyzed
- **Business value extracted**: Core business problem and value proposition identified
- **Technology stack detected**: Primary language and supporting technologies determined
- **Project scale assessed**: Appropriate startup/sme/enterprise classification assigned
- **Success criteria defined**: Measurable business outcomes and technical deliverables specified

### CLAUDE.md Template Compliance
- **All metadata populated**: Section 0 completely filled with project-specific information
- **Business goals measurable**: Section 2 contains 3-5 specific, achievable objectives
- **Technology stack coherent**: Section 3 technologies work together and support business goals
- **Agent selection optimal**: Section 4 agents chosen specifically for project needs
- **Quality standards appropriate**: Non-functional requirements match project scale and domain

### Configuration Accuracy and Feasibility
- **Domain expertise alignment**: Selected technologies appropriate for business domain
- **Scale-complexity match**: Project scale aligns with described complexity and resource requirements
- **Timeline feasibility**: Technology choices support realistic development timelines
- **Integration viability**: External system integrations are technically feasible
- **Agent workflow optimization**: Selected agents enable effective coordination and handoffs
