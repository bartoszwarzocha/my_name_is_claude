# Existing Project Integration Prompt

**Drag-and-drop ready! Just paste this prompt and I'll safely integrate the agent framework.**

## üîß Integrate Agent Framework into Existing Project

I'll help you safely add the Claude Code Agent Framework with 11 specialized agents to your existing project. I'll analyze everything first and make no changes without your approval.

### Step 1: Comprehensive Project Analysis

Let me analyze your existing project automatically:

1. **Project Structure Discovery:**
   - Main directories and their purposes
   - Entry points and configuration files
   - Build system and dependency management
   - Testing setup and CI/CD configuration

2. **Technology Stack Detection:**
   - Programming languages and frameworks
   - Database systems and data stores
   - Frontend/backend architecture patterns
   - Deployment and infrastructure setup

3. **Business Context Analysis:**
   - Project purpose from README/docs
   - Business domain identification
   - User base and scale indicators
   - Current development stage assessment

4. **Existing Tooling Assessment:**
   - Development tools and IDE configurations
   - Quality assurance and testing tools
   - Documentation and project management
   - Version control and collaboration setup

### Step 2: Intelligent Integration Planning

Based on my analysis, I'll create a safe integration plan:

**If CLAUDE.md already exists:**
- I'll read current configuration and adapt to it
- Preserve all existing settings and preferences
- Only suggest improvements, not replacements

**If no CLAUDE.md exists:**
- I'll create one that perfectly matches your current setup
- Document existing architecture without changing it
- Map current tools to appropriate agent roles

**Integration Safety Check:**
- ‚ùå Will NOT modify any existing source code
- ‚ùå Will NOT change build/deployment configurations  
- ‚ùå Will NOT alter existing package managers or dependencies
- ‚úÖ Will ONLY add agent framework documentation and configuration
- ‚úÖ Will CREATE Serena integration that respects existing setup

### Step 3: Smart Information Gathering

I'll only ask for information I can't detect:

**If project name is unclear:**
- What should I call this project in the agent framework?

**If business domain is unclear:**
- What business domain does this project serve? (ecommerce, fintech, healthcare, saas, enterprise, iot, other)

**If development stage is unclear:**
- What stage is this project in? (prototype, mvp, development, production, maintenance)

**AI Development Tools (I'll always ask about these):**
- Do you want to use **Serena** for code navigation and intelligent editing? (y/n)
- Do you want to use **Context7** for advanced code generation and migrations? (y/n)

**TODO Management Integration Assessment (I'll always ask about these):**
- Do you want to integrate **TODO management** into your existing workflow? (y/n)
  - If yes: What integration approach? (gradual/immediate/pilot)
  - If yes: Which complexity level fits your team? (simple/hierarchical)
  - If yes: Do you want agents to create tasks automatically? (y/n)
  - If yes: What progress tracking scope? (session/project/enterprise)
- Do you have existing project management tools? (jira/asana/trello/none)
  - If yes: Do you want TODO system to integrate with them? (y/n)

**If special requirements exist:**
- Any specific compliance, security, or performance requirements?
- Any existing conventions I should follow?

### Step 4: Safe Integration Execution

Once I understand your project, I'll:

1. **Create Non-Disruptive CLAUDE.md:**
   - Project metadata reflecting CURRENT state
   - Technology stack documentation of EXISTING setup
   - Business domain configuration for YOUR use case
   - Agent roles mapped to YOUR current architecture
   - **TODO Management Configuration (Section 8)** based on your preferences:
     - Integration approach (gradual/immediate/pilot)
     - Complexity level adapted to your team size and workflow
     - External tool integration settings (Jira/Asana/Trello)
     - Gradual adoption timeline and milestones
   - **ZERO changes to existing functionality**

2. **Set up AI Tools Integration (if requested):**
   - **Serena**: `.serena` directory with safe configuration and `project.yml` tailored to your setup
   - **Context7**: Configuration for advanced code generation and migrations
   - Both tools respect existing project structure and conventions
   - Intelligent ignore patterns to avoid conflicts with existing tools
   - Option for read-only mode initially for maximum safety

3. **Create Integration Documentation:**
   - Agent usage guide tailored to your project and chosen AI tools
   - AI tools configuration documentation (Serena/Context7 usage patterns)
   - **TODO Management Integration Guide:**
     - Mapping current workflow to agent TODO coordination
     - Integration timeline with existing project management tools
     - Agent training guide for TODO system adoption
     - Success metrics and progress tracking setup
   - Quick wins where agents and AI tools can help immediately
   - Gradual adoption roadmap for both agents and AI tools

### Step 5: Adoption Strategy

I'll provide you with:

**Immediate Value Agents:**
- `business-analyst` - for requirements clarification
- `reviewer` - for quality validation and risk assessment
- `security-engineer` - for security analysis of existing code

**Quick Win Opportunities:**
- Documentation improvement with agent insights
- Code quality assessment and recommendations  
- Architecture analysis and optimization suggestions
- Security audit and compliance gap analysis

**TODO Management Integration Timeline:**
- **Pilot Phase**: Single agent (reviewer) with simple TodoWrite integration
- **Phase 1**: Core agents (business-analyst, software-architect) with feature-level todos
- **Phase 2**: Implementation agents (frontend, api, data) with task coordination
- **Phase 3**: Full hierarchical system with external tool integration
- **Phase 4**: Advanced analytics and automated workflow optimization

**Long-term Integration Plan:**
- Phase 1: Analysis and documentation (safe)
- Phase 2: Quality and security improvements (low risk)
- Phase 3: Development workflow integration (when ready)
- Phase 4: Full agent-driven development (optional)

### Integration Safety Guarantees

**What I WILL do:**
- ‚úÖ Analyze your project thoroughly and safely
- ‚úÖ Create documentation that reflects current state
- ‚úÖ Set up agent framework without disrupting workflow
- ‚úÖ Provide immediate value through analysis and guidance
- ‚úÖ Give you control over adoption pace

**What I WILL NOT do:**
- ‚ùå Change any existing code without explicit permission
- ‚ùå Modify build systems, CI/CD, or deployment configs
- ‚ùå Alter dependency management or package files
- ‚ùå Break existing workflows or development practices
- ‚ùå Make assumptions about desired changes
