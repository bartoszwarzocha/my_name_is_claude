# Session Context Analysis and Initialization

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Analyze current project state, establish session context, and create actionable work plan for productive development session. Discover project characteristics, assess development momentum, validate framework configuration, and identify priority tasks based on recent changes and project timeline. Enable informed decision-making about session focus and agent coordination.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Project State Discovery and Analysis
1. **Scan project configuration** - Read CLAUDE.md, detect framework setup, identify configured agents and technologies
2. **Analyze project structure** - Evaluate directory organization, build systems, and development environment status
3. **Assess recent changes** - Review git log, file modifications, and development momentum indicators
4. **Identify project characteristics** - Determine scale, domain, development stage, and business priorities
5. **Validate framework integration** - Check agent availability, TODO management setup, and tool configurations

### Phase 2: Development Context and Priority Assessment
1. **Review work continuity** - Analyze previous session summaries, work progress, and pending tasks
2. **Identify active development areas** - Find recent code changes, feature development, and pending issues
3. **Assess project health** - Check build status, test results, code quality, and documentation currency
4. **Evaluate blockers and dependencies** - Identify impediments, external dependencies, and technical debt
5. **Determine session priorities** - Based on business goals, timeline constraints, and development momentum

### Phase 3: Context Integration and Session Planning
1. **Synthesize project status** - Combine discovery findings into comprehensive project state assessment
2. **Identify immediate opportunities** - Find quick wins, urgent fixes, and high-value development tasks
3. **Plan agent coordination** - Determine which agents are needed and optimal collaboration patterns
4. **Configure TODO management** - Set up session task tracking and progress monitoring
5. **Establish session objectives** - Define clear goals, success criteria, and expected outcomes

### Phase 4: Session Initialization and Handoff
1. **Generate session plan** - Create structured work plan with priorities, tasks, and agent assignments
2. **Validate readiness** - Confirm all tools, dependencies, and resources are available for productive work
3. **Initialize progress tracking** - Set up TODO management and session monitoring systems
4. **Provide context summary** - Document findings and recommendations for session execution
5. **Enable smooth handoff** - Prepare context for immediate productive work or agent engagement
