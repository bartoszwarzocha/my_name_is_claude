## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: State Architecture and Data Flow Implementation
**Objective**: Design comprehensive state management architecture and implement data synchronization

1. **State Structure and Data Flow Design**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md business_domain to identify state entities and relationships, choose appropriate management pattern based on complexity
   - Design normalized state structure with clear separation between local and global state, establish unidirectional data flow
   - Create semantic actions representing business operations, handle asynchronous operations with error handling and loading states

2. **Performance Optimization and Development Experience**
   - Implement memoized selectors and state update batching, deploy dynamic module loading and memory management
   - Configure comprehensive state debugging with time-travel capabilities, implement visualization and testing utilities
   - Deploy state consistency validation, migration strategies, and enable analytics for user behavior insights and optimization
