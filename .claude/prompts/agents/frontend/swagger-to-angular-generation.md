# API Client Generation Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Generate comprehensive, type-safe frontend API clients from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications ensuring seamless integration with frontend applications, proper TypeScript typing, and production-ready error handling and HTTP client configuration while adapting to technology stack defined in CLAUDE.md.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: API Analysis and Client Generation
**Objective**: Analyze API specifications and implement comprehensive client generation

1. **API Specification Analysis and Planning**
   - Analyze OpenAPI/Swagger specifications to examine endpoints, data models, and integration requirements
   - Design API client architecture, plan type safety approach, and establish authentication integration
   - Define testing strategy with API client testing, mock strategies, and validation approaches

2. **API Client Generation and Implementation**
   - Generate type-safe interfaces, implement HTTP client configuration, and create service layer abstraction
   - Apply error handling patterns, integrate authentication flows, and configure request/response handling
   - Create TypeScript interfaces, retry logic, OAuth implementation, and graceful failure handling

### Phase 2: Advanced Features and Integration Excellence
**Objective**: Execute advanced features and establish integration excellence

1. **Advanced Features and Optimization**
   - Implement advanced HTTP features, create mock services, and apply data transformation with validation
   - Integrate real-time features, optimize bundle size, and add caching with request deduplication
   - Create WebSocket support, tree shaking, streaming data, code splitting, and performance optimization

2. **Integration and Maintenance Excellence**
   - Create comprehensive testing, establish documentation with usage guides, and implement monitoring
   - Create update procedures, enable team collaboration, and configure automated generation workflows
   - Implement unit tests, client documentation, API usage monitoring, version management, and team integration
