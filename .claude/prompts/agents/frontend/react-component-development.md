# React Component Development Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Develop high-quality, reusable React components with TypeScript integration, modern React patterns, performance optimization, and accessibility compliance. Create component architectures leveraging hooks, context, concurrent features, and advanced patterns while adapting to project requirements defined in CLAUDE.md.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Component Architecture and Implementation
**Objective**: Analyze requirements and implement comprehensive React component architecture

1. **Component Architecture and Design Planning**
   - Analyze component requirements to determine responsibilities, composition patterns, and reusability requirements
   - Design component props interface, state management architecture, and establish performance optimization strategy
   - Define accessibility requirements with WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation, and inclusive design patterns

2. **React Component Implementation**
   - Implement modern React structure, state management, and apply performance optimization techniques
   - Implement accessibility features, create component testing, and integrate TypeScript interfaces
   - Create functional components with hooks, React.memo, ARIA attributes, unit tests, and modern patterns

### Phase 2: Advanced Patterns and Testing Excellence
**Objective**: Execute advanced patterns and establish comprehensive testing excellence

1. **Advanced Patterns and Optimization**
   - Apply advanced React patterns, optimize rendering performance, and implement error handling with boundaries
   - Integrate design system theming, optimize bundle size, and create efficient re-rendering strategies
   - Create compound components, virtualization, graceful failure handling, code splitting, and loading optimization

2. **Testing and Documentation Excellence**
   - Create comprehensive testing, establish documentation with examples, and implement monitoring with error tracking
   - Create maintenance procedures, enable team collaboration, and establish contribution guidelines
   - Implement unit tests, usage examples, performance monitoring, component versioning, and knowledge sharing
