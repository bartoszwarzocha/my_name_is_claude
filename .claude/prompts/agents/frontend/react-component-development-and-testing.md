# React Component Development and Testing Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement scalable, maintainable React components with comprehensive testing strategies following modern development practices, design system principles, and accessibility standards. Create performant, reusable, and thoroughly tested component architectures adapted to CLAUDE.md technology stack and project requirements.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Component Architecture and Implementation
**Objective**: Design and develop React components with modern patterns

1. **Component Architecture and Design Planning**
   - Analyze component requirements, business logic, data flow, and user interaction patterns
   - Design component hierarchy using container/presentational patterns and composition strategies
   - Define component interfaces with TypeScript and plan state management architecture

2. **Component Implementation and Development**
   - Implement component structure with modern React patterns, hooks, and performance optimization
   - Integrate state management, side effect handling, styling, and design system integration
   - Implement accessibility features, ARIA patterns, and optimize component performance

### Phase 2: Testing and Quality Assurance
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive testing and establish maintenance excellence

1. **Testing Strategy and Implementation**
   - Design comprehensive testing strategy with unit, integration, accessibility, and visual regression testing
   - Implement component unit testing for behavior, props, state changes, and user interactions
   - Create integration testing scenarios and establish continuous testing with CI/CD integration

2. **Documentation and Maintenance Excellence**
   - Create comprehensive component documentation with APIs, usage examples, and integration patterns
   - Establish storybook integration, monitoring, error tracking, and maintenance procedures
   - Enable team collaboration workflows with code review processes and contribution guidelines

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
