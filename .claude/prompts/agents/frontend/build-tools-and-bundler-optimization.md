## ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Implement comprehensive build optimization for modern frontend applications with efficient development workflows, production build optimization through advanced code splitting and tree shaking, asset optimization strategies including compression and caching, and build analytics for continuous optimization. Enable module federation for micro-frontend architectures, dynamic imports and lazy loading, progressive build strategies with incremental compilation, and advanced bundling techniques. Support multiple development environments with fast HMR, build debugging tools, automated testing in CI/CD pipelines, build caching strategies, parallel processing, and memory-efficient processes for large-scale applications.
