## ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: WCAG Foundation and Interactive Implementation
**Objective**: Implement accessibility architecture and comprehensive WCAG compliance

1. **Accessibility Architecture and WCAG Foundation**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md project requirements for accessibility compliance level and implement patterns compatible with detected technology stack
   - Structure semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchies, ARIA attributes, and establish focus management patterns with screen reader optimization
   - Create logical tab order with visible focus indicators, implement keyboard alternatives, and deploy form accessibility with validation feedback

2. **Visual Accessibility and Quality Assurance**
   - Validate color combinations meeting WCAG standards with responsive typography and provide user controls for animations
   - Implement clear navigation patterns, help text, error recovery mechanisms, and enable customizable interface preferences
   - Integrate accessibility scanning tools in CI/CD pipeline, establish testing protocols, and enable analytics with continuous monitoring
