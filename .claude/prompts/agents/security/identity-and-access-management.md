# Identity and Access Management Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Establish comprehensive identity and access management framework that provides secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication and authorization across all systems and applications. Design technology-adaptive IAM solutions that support zero trust architecture while maintaining regulatory compliance and operational efficiency.

**CLAUDE.md Adaptation**: Analyze primary_language and infrastructure for appropriate authentication protocols and authorization patterns, apply business_domain compliance requirements for identity governance frameworks, adapt IAM complexity based on project_scale and user population, ensure solutions enhance user experience and business operations

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Identity Architecture and Infrastructure Design
**Objective**: Design and implement comprehensive identity architecture with scalable infrastructure and authentication strategies

1. **Identity Domain and Authentication Strategy**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md requirements designing identity federation, lifecycle management, and governance frameworks
   - Implement multi-factor, adaptive, and passwordless authentication with risk-based decisions

2. **Authorization and Infrastructure Implementation**
   - Deploy role-based and attribute-based access control with privileged access management
   - Implement identity providers, directory services, and standards-based protocols (SAML, OAuth, OIDC, SCIM)

### Phase 2: Access Governance and Monitoring
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive governance, compliance, and continuous improvement with monitoring and threat detection

1. **Lifecycle and Policy Management**
   - Implement automated provisioning/deprovisioning workflows with access reviews and certification
   - Establish centralized policy management with compliance monitoring and violation detection

2. **Privileged Access and Threat Detection**
   - Deploy privileged account management with session monitoring and just-in-time access
   - Implement threat detection, user behavior analytics, and performance optimization

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
