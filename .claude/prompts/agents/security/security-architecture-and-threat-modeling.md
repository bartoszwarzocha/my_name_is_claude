# Security Architecture and Threat Modeling Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Establish comprehensive security architecture frameworks and systematic threat modeling methodologies that identify, analyze, and prioritize security risks throughout the application and infrastructure lifecycle. Design defense-in-depth security architectures aligned with business objectives while implementing systematic threat analysis processes that enable informed security investment decisions and regulatory compliance.

**CLAUDE.md Adaptation**: Analyze infrastructure model and deployment approach for appropriate security architecture patterns, apply business domain and project scale for threat landscape and risk tolerance frameworks, implement regulatory-specific security controls based on compliance requirements, adapt security complexity to project scale and organizational maturity

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Security Architecture Design and Threat Modeling
**Objective**: Design comprehensive security architecture and conduct systematic threat identification with structured analysis

1. **Security Architecture Framework Development**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md business domain and project scale determining security objectives and principles
   - Design perimeter, application, data, and infrastructure security architecture with zero trust principles
   - Establish cloud, hybrid, or on-premise security patterns based on deployment model
   - Implement identity-centric security with network micro-segmentation and application protection

2. **Comprehensive Threat Modeling and Analysis**
   - Conduct STRIDE threat analysis across authentication, data integrity, audit logging, information disclosure, availability, and privilege escalation
   - Create attack trees for critical business assets modeling attack paths and calculating probability
   - Profile relevant threat actors analyzing industry-specific patterns and supply chain risks
   - Assess business impact of confidentiality, integrity, and availability compromises with asset prioritization

### Phase 2: Risk Assessment and Implementation Planning
**Objective**: Calculate quantitative risk metrics and create actionable implementation plans with governance frameworks

1. **Quantitative Risk Assessment and Investment Analysis**
   - Calculate Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE), Single Loss Expectancy (SLE), and Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
   - Analyze security investment ROI and cost-benefit ratios for different architecture approaches
   - Prioritize risks based on business impact, likelihood, and mitigation feasibility
   - Develop risk treatment strategies with implementation roadmaps and monitoring procedures

2. **Implementation Planning and Governance Framework**
   - Design security control implementation roadmap with priority-based sequencing and integration points
   - Establish security architecture governance processes with stakeholder involvement
   - Create compliance validation procedures for regulatory requirements and audit readiness
   - Implement continuous compliance monitoring and reporting with change management processes
