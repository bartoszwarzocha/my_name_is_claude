# Secure Code Review and SAST Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Establish comprehensive secure code review processes and static application security testing (SAST) programs that systematically identify, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities across the entire codebase. Integrate automated security scanning with expert manual review processes to achieve maximum vulnerability detection coverage while minimizing false positives and maintaining developer productivity.

**CLAUDE.md Adaptation Requirements:**
- **Technology Stack Detection**: Analyze primary_language and technology specifications to select appropriate SAST tools and custom rule sets
- **Business Domain Integration**: Apply industry-specific security patterns and compliance requirements from business_domain configuration
- **Development Workflow Integration**: Align security review processes with project scale and development stage maturity
- **Compliance Framework Mapping**: Implement regulatory-specific security controls based on business domain and geographic scope

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: SAST Architecture and Expert Review Implementation
**Objective**: Design technology-adaptive static analysis framework with comprehensive expert review processes

1. **Technology Analysis and Tool Integration**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md specifications to determine optimal SAST tool combinations and custom rule development
   - Design CI/CD pipeline integration with IDE plugins and quality gates aligned with compliance requirements

2. **Expert Review and Risk Assessment**
   - Establish security review methodology with risk-based prioritization for authentication, authorization, and cryptographic changes
   - Implement knowledge transfer programs with security champions and continuous learning feedback loops

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Management and Continuous Improvement
**Objective**: Create unified vulnerability management with measurement and optimization frameworks

1. **Finding Management and Remediation**
   - Normalize findings across tools with business impact scoring and CVE/CWE mapping
   - Calculate composite risk scores for prioritized remediation with security debt management

2. **Developer Experience and Process Optimization**
   - Integrate findings into developer workflows with automated remediation suggestions
   - Track detection rates, measure accuracy, and optimize configurations for continuous improvement

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Security and Process Validation
**Detection and Integration Effectiveness**:
- Achieve >90% critical vulnerability detection with <15% false positive rate
- Ensure seamless CI/CD integration with <24h review turnaround for critical changes
- Maintain >98% high-risk code coverage with >85% review accuracy

**Remediation and Compliance Excellence**:
- Achieve <7 days mean time to remediation for critical vulnerabilities
- Ensure 100% regulatory compliance with continuous monitoring capabilities
- Validate >90% developer skill improvement and >95% satisfaction with review process
