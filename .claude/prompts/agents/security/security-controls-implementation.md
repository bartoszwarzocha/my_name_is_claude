# Security Controls Implementation Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Establish comprehensive security controls implementation framework that provides defense-in-depth protection across all technology layers while maintaining operational efficiency and business functionality. Design technology-adaptive security controls that integrate seamlessly with existing systems and scale with organizational growth.

**CLAUDE.md Adaptation Requirements:**
- **Technology-Specific Controls**: Analyze primary_language and infrastructure model to implement appropriate security controls for detected technology stack
- **Business Domain Security**: Apply business_domain requirements to implement industry-specific security controls and compliance measures
- **Scale-Appropriate Implementation**: Adapt control complexity and automation levels based on project_scale and organizational maturity
- **Operational Integration**: Ensure security controls enhance rather than impede business operations and development workflows

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Architecture Design and Preventive Controls Implementation
**Objective**: Design defense-in-depth security architecture and implement preventive controls

1. **Control Framework and Defense-in-Depth Design**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md specifications to determine appropriate security control frameworks and compliance mapping
   - Design perimeter, network, host-based, and application security controls with integration orchestration

2. **Preventive Controls Implementation**
   - Implement identity/access management with multi-factor authentication and role-based access control
   - Deploy network segmentation, application security controls, and data protection with encryption

### Phase 2: Detective and Recovery Controls Implementation
**Objective**: Implement detective controls for threat detection and recovery controls for incident response

1. **Monitoring and Threat Detection**
   - Deploy comprehensive logging, SIEM systems, and behavioral analytics with threat intelligence integration
   - Implement vulnerability management with continuous scanning and incident detection/response systems

2. **Recovery and Continuous Improvement**
   - Establish automated incident response, business continuity, and security control remediation procedures
   - Implement control effectiveness measurement, optimization, and threat landscape adaptation

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
