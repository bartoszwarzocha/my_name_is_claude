# Incident Response and Digital Forensics Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Establish comprehensive incident response and digital forensics capabilities that enable rapid security incident containment, thorough forensic investigation, and effective evidence preservation. Design technology-adaptive response procedures that maintain business continuity while ensuring regulatory compliance and comprehensive threat analysis.

**CLAUDE.md Adaptation Requirements:**
- **Technology-Specific Response**: Analyze primary_language and infrastructure model to implement appropriate forensic tools and investigation techniques
- **Business Domain Incident Patterns**: Apply business_domain knowledge to customize incident classification and response procedures for industry-specific threats
- **Scale-Appropriate Response**: Adapt incident response team structure and resource allocation based on project_scale and organizational complexity
- **Compliance-Integrated Investigation**: Ensure forensic procedures meet regulatory requirements identified in business_domain compliance frameworks

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Detection and Investigation
**Objective**: Detect, classify, investigate incidents and collect legal-quality evidence

1. **Incident Detection and Classification**
   - Implement automated detection with behavioral analytics and alert correlation
   - Establish classification framework based on business impact and technical severity
   - Activate incident command structure with clear roles and communication protocols
   - Conduct rapid impact assessment and determine resource requirements

2. **Forensic Investigation and Evidence Collection**
   - Preserve evidence maintaining legal admissibility and chain of custody
   - Create forensic images and analyze system logs, network traffic, and application data
   - Conduct timeline analysis and root cause investigation
   - Correlate threat intelligence and assess attacker attribution

### Phase 2: Containment and Recovery
**Objective**: Contain threats, restore operations, and implement preventive improvements

1. **Threat Containment and Eradication**
   - Implement containment procedures preserving evidence while limiting spread
   - Remove threats, patch vulnerabilities, and validate threat elimination
   - Coordinate with business continuity and manage stakeholder communication
   - Restore systems from clean backups with enhanced security configurations

2. **Recovery and Continuous Improvement**
   - Systematically restore services with enhanced monitoring capabilities
   - Fulfill regulatory notification requirements and coordinate legal compliance
   - Conduct post-incident review and implement security architecture improvements
   - Update procedures, enhance training, and share threat intelligence
