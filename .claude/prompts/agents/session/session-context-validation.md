# Session Context Validation and Integrity Assurance

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Validate session context integrity, detect corruption, and ensure reliable session state before initialization or restoration. Perform comprehensive validation of stored session summaries, project state consistency, TODO tracking accuracy, and MCP tools integration status. Identify context inconsistencies, repair corrupted data where possible, and provide clear guidance for session recovery or reinitialization when validation fails.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Context Integrity Assessment and Validation
1. **Validate stored session state files** - Check existence, format, and completeness of SESSION_STATE.md, SESSION_TODOS.md, and CONTINUATION_CONTEXT.md
2. **Verify project state consistency** - Compare stored context with current project files, git history, and configuration changes
3. **Assess context timestamp validity** - Evaluate context age, identify stale data, and determine if refresh is needed
4. **Validate cross-reference accuracy** - Check internal references, file paths, and dependency relationships in stored context
5. **Detect context corruption indicators** - Identify inconsistencies, missing data, or format violations in session files

### Phase 2: Project State Synchronization Validation
1. **Compare current vs stored project structure** - Validate directory structure, file existence, and organizational changes
2. **Verify git repository consistency** - Check for new commits, branch changes, or repository state modifications
3. **Assess configuration drift** - Compare current CLAUDE.md, package files, and environment settings with stored context
4. **Validate external dependencies** - Check availability of databases, APIs, services, and integration points referenced in context
5. **Identify breaking changes** - Detect modifications that could invalidate stored session assumptions or workflows

### Phase 3: MCP Tools and Integration Validation
1. **Verify MCP tools availability and status** - Check Serena, Context7, Playwright, and other configured tools accessibility
2. **Validate tool configuration consistency** - Ensure MCP tool settings match current project requirements and stored context
3. **Assess integration point functionality** - Test critical tool integrations and identify any configuration or connectivity issues
4. **Check tool version compatibility** - Verify MCP tools versions are compatible with stored session requirements
5. **Validate tool-specific context data** - Ensure Serena indices, Context7 mappings, and other tool data are current and accurate

### Phase 4: Context Repair and Recovery Strategies
1. **Attempt automatic context repair** - Fix minor inconsistencies, update stale references, and resolve simple format issues
2. **Generate context refresh recommendations** - Identify areas requiring manual review or complete context regeneration
3. **Create validation report with actionable guidance** - Document all issues found with specific resolution steps
4. **Provide session initialization alternatives** - Recommend whether to proceed with current context, refresh specific components, or restart completely
5. **Establish context validation checkpoints** - Set up ongoing validation procedures to prevent future corruption

### Phase 5: Quality Assurance and Monitoring Integration
1. **Implement context health monitoring** - Create continuous validation processes for active sessions
2. **Establish validation metrics and thresholds** - Define acceptable context quality levels and degradation indicators
3. **Create validation automation** - Set up automatic context validation during session transitions and key operations
4. **Generate validation performance analytics** - Track validation effectiveness and identify improvement opportunities
5. **Integrate with framework quality gates** - Ensure context validation aligns with overall framework quality standards
