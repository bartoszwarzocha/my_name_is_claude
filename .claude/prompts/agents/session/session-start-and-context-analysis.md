**ðŸ¤– AGENT ACTIVATION:** This prompt automatically activates the `session-manager` agent.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT:** The activated agent will read CLAUDE.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ TODO INTEGRATION:** All tasks will be managed through the agent's TodoWrite workflow.

# Session Context Analysis and Initialization

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Analyze current project state, establish session context, and create actionable work plan for productive development session. Discover project characteristics, assess development momentum, validate framework configuration, and identify priority tasks based on recent changes and project timeline. Enable informed decision-making about session focus and agent coordination.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Project Discovery and Context Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze project state and implement comprehensive development context assessment

1. **Project State Discovery and Analysis**
   - Scan project configuration reading CLAUDE.md, detecting framework setup, and identifying configured agents
   - Analyze project structure evaluating directory organization, build systems, and development environment status
   - Assess recent changes, identify project characteristics, and validate framework integration

2. **Development Context and Session Planning**
   - Review work continuity analyzing previous session summaries, work progress, and pending tasks
   - Identify active development areas, assess project health, and evaluate blockers and dependencies
   - Synthesize project status, identify immediate opportunities, and plan agent coordination with session objectives

### Phase 2: MCP Integration and Session Initialization
**Objective**: Execute MCP tools integration and establish comprehensive session initialization

1. **MCP Tools Integration and Enhancement (If Available)**
   - Detect and configure Serena MCP checking for .serena directory and establishing tool integration
   - Load project knowledge base retrieving project index and navigation context from Serena
   - Enhance context analysis, optimize tool configuration, and validate enhanced context

2. **Session Initialization and Handoff**
   - Generate comprehensive session plan creating structured work plan leveraging framework and Serena insights
   - Validate readiness confirming all tools and dependencies are available for productive work
   - Initialize progress tracking, provide context summary, and enable smooth handoff for agent engagement
