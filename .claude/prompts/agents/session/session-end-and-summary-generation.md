2. **Write session state to persistent storage** - Save summary to SESSION_STATE.md file for cross-session continuity
3. **Update project documentation** - Sync relevant discoveries and decisions with project knowledge base
4. **Persist current TODO status** - Write current task status to SESSION_TODOS.md for continuation tracking
5. **Create continuation context file** - Generate structured handoff information in CONTINUATION_CONTEXT.md

### Phase 5: MCP Tools Integration (If Available)
1. **Detect Serena MCP availability** - Check for .serena directory existence and tool accessibility
2. **Synchronize project state with Serena** - Update Serena's project index with session changes and new files
3. **Trigger comprehensive reindexing** - Refresh Serena's code navigation and search capabilities
4. **Validate Serena integration** - Ensure project knowledge is properly indexed and searchable
5. **Update Serena project configuration** - Sync any project structure or workflow changes with Serena settings
