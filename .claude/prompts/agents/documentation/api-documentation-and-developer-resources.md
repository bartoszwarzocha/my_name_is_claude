# API Documentation and Developer Resource Creation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive API documentation and developer resource systems enabling rapid developer onboarding, successful integrations, and efficient API adoption. Create developer-focused frameworks adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with API reference documentation, integration guides, code examples, and developer portal experiences across different technology stacks.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Documentation Strategy and API Reference Implementation
**Objective**: Analyze requirements and implement comprehensive API documentation infrastructure

1. **API Documentation Strategy and Developer Experience Planning**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md API requirements to extract complexity levels, developer audience needs, and integration objectives
   - Define API documentation strategy with developer experience framework, content organization, and success measurement
   - Establish documentation standards, content architecture, and developer portal integration planning

2. **API Reference Documentation and Technical Specification**
   - Configure comprehensive API reference with endpoint documentation, parameter descriptions, and response schemas
   - Design interactive API exploration with testing tools, live documentation, and sandbox environments
   - Implement code examples, SDK documentation, authentication guides, and API versioning documentation

### Phase 2: Developer Experience and Advanced Features
**Objective**: Implement developer onboarding resources and advanced documentation capabilities

1. **Developer Onboarding and Integration Guides**
   - Create comprehensive getting started guides with quick start tutorials and first API call workflows
   - Design integration tutorials with step-by-step guides, use case examples, and troubleshooting resources
   - Configure developer tools, community resources, and comprehensive support infrastructure

2. **Advanced Features and Continuous Improvement**
   - Implement developer analytics with success measurement, usage tracking, and adoption metrics
   - Design automated documentation generation with code synchronization and content freshness management
   - Create feedback systems, education resources, and continuous documentation evolution
