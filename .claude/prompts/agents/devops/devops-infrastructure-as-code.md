# Infrastructure as Code Framework Development and Automation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC) frameworks enabling consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled infrastructure management. Create systematic IaC strategies adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with infrastructure automation, configuration management, environment standardization, and operational governance across different cloud platforms.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: IaC Strategy and Template Development
**Objective**: Analyze requirements and implement comprehensive Infrastructure as Code framework

1. **IaC Strategy Analysis and Framework Architecture**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md infrastructure requirements to extract cloud platforms, scalability needs, and operational constraints
   - Define IaC strategy with framework architecture, tool selection, and governance establishment
   - Design infrastructure standards with reusable templates, naming conventions, and toolchain integration

2. **Infrastructure Templates and Module Development**
   - Create foundational infrastructure templates with base patterns, networking templates, and security frameworks
   - Design reusable component modules with standardization, versioning, and lifecycle management
   - Establish validation procedures, testing automation, documentation, and knowledge management

### Phase 2: Deployment Automation and Operational Excellence
**Objective**: Implement deployment automation and advanced IaC capabilities

1. **Deployment Automation and Environment Management**
   - Implement automated infrastructure provisioning with deployment pipelines and environment orchestration
   - Design environment management with configuration templates, isolation, and monitoring with drift detection
   - Configure disaster recovery automation, security policies, and compliance validation

2. **Advanced Features and Operational Excellence**
   - Implement infrastructure scaling with auto-scaling templates, optimization automation, and cost management
   - Design multi-environment orchestration with multi-cloud templates and hybrid infrastructure management
   - Create analytics, performance optimization, governance enforcement, and continuous improvement
