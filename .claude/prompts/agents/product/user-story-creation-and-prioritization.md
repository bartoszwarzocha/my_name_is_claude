# User Story Creation and Prioritization

**Agent: product-manager**
**Purpose: Transform business requirements into prioritized user stories with clear acceptance criteria**

---

## üéØ Mission

Create well-structured user stories that translate business requirements into actionable development tasks, prioritized by business value and user impact.

## üìã User Story Framework

### Step 1: User Story Structure
Use the standard format: **"As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]"**

**Components to include:**
- **User persona** and role definition
- **Functional requirement** clearly stated
- **Business value** and user benefit
- **Acceptance criteria** with specific conditions
- **Definition of Done** checklist

### Step 2: Story Categories

**Epic Level Stories:**
- Large features spanning multiple sprints
- High-level business capabilities
- Cross-functional requirements

**Feature Level Stories:**
- Specific functionality within an epic  
- Can be completed in 1-3 sprints
- Clear user value delivery

**Task Level Stories:**
- Granular implementation details
- Single sprint completion
- Technical or support tasks

### Step 3: Acceptance Criteria Development

For each story, define:
- **Given-When-Then** scenarios
- **Functional requirements** (what the system must do)
- **Non-functional requirements** (performance, security, usability)
- **Edge cases** and error handling
- **Integration points** with other systems

## üèÜ Prioritization Framework

### MoSCoW Method
- **Must Have:** Critical for MVP launch
- **Should Have:** Important for user satisfaction  
- **Could Have:** Nice to have features
- **Won't Have:** Explicitly out of scope

### Value vs Effort Matrix
Plot stories on 2x2 matrix:
- **High Value, Low Effort:** Quick wins (prioritize first)
- **High Value, High Effort:** Major projects (plan carefully)
- **Low Value, Low Effort:** Fill gaps if time permits
- **Low Value, High Effort:** Avoid or deprioritize

### Business Value Scoring
Rate each story 1-10 on:
- **User impact** and satisfaction improvement
- **Business revenue** potential
- **Risk reduction** value
- **Strategic alignment** with company goals
- **Competitive advantage** creation

## üìù Story Writing Best Practices

**INVEST Criteria:**
- **Independent:** Can be developed separately
- **Negotiable:** Details can be discussed and refined
- **Valuable:** Delivers clear user or business value
- **Estimable:** Development effort can be estimated
- **Small:** Fits within a sprint timeframe  
- **Testable:** Clear acceptance criteria for validation

**Common Templates:**

**Feature Story:**
```
As a [user role]
I want [functionality]
So that [business value]

Acceptance Criteria:
- Given [context]
  When [action]
  Then [expected result]
- [Additional scenarios...]

Definition of Done:
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] User documentation updated
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
```

## üéØ Backlog Management

### Backlog Structure
1. **Product Vision** and roadmap alignment
2. **Release Planning** with major milestones
3. **Sprint Planning** with ready stories
4. **Backlog Refinement** and continuous prioritization

### Story Lifecycle
1. **Idea** ‚Üí Initial concept or requirement
2. **Defined** ‚Üí Story written with acceptance criteria
3. **Estimated** ‚Üí Development effort estimated
4. **Ready** ‚Üí Meets Definition of Ready
5. **In Progress** ‚Üí Development started
6. **Done** ‚Üí Meets Definition of Done

## ü§ù Collaboration Points

**With business-analyst:** Validate business requirements alignment
**With ux-designer:** Ensure user experience consistency
**With development teams:** Refine technical feasibility and estimates
**With qa-engineer:** Review testability and acceptance criteria

## üìä Success Metrics

- **Story completion rate** within sprints
- **User satisfaction** with delivered features
- **Business value realization** against predictions
- **Development velocity** and predictability
- **Defect rates** in delivered stories

## üì§ Deliverables

- **Product Backlog** with prioritized user stories
- **Sprint Planning** materials and story details
- **Acceptance Criteria** for each story
- **Definition of Done** checklists
- **Release Planning** timeline and milestones
