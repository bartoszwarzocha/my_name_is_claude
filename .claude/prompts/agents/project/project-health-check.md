# Comprehensive Project Health Assessment and Analysis

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Conduct comprehensive analysis of project health across technical, business, and operational dimensions. Evaluate code quality, architecture soundness, security posture, performance characteristics, and business alignment to identify risks, opportunities, and actionable improvements. Provide stakeholders with clear visibility into project status and strategic recommendations.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Technical Health and Security Assessment
**Objective**: Analyze technical excellence and implement comprehensive security evaluation

1. **Technical Health Assessment**
   - Analyze code quality metrics evaluating test coverage, complexity, maintainability scores, and technical debt indicators
   - Assess build and deployment health reviewing success rates, frequency, rollback rates, and pipeline reliability
   - Evaluate dependency management, architecture integrity, and performance characteristics

2. **Security and Compliance Evaluation**
   - Conduct security posture assessment scanning vulnerabilities and evaluating authentication mechanisms
   - Analyze compliance requirements assessing adherence to industry standards and regulatory requirements
   - Review data handling practices, third-party risk exposure, and incident response readiness

### Phase 2: Business Alignment and Risk Management
**Objective**: Execute business value assessment and establish comprehensive risk management

1. **Business Alignment and Value Assessment**
   - Evaluate business goal alignment assessing project outcomes support for business objectives and KPIs
   - Analyze user satisfaction indicators reviewing feedback, adoption rates, and usage patterns
   - Assess market competitiveness, resource utilization efficiency, and future sustainability

2. **Risk Assessment and Recommendation Generation**
   - Identify critical risk factors cataloging technical, security, business, and operational risks with impact assessment
   - Prioritize improvement opportunities and generate actionable remediation plans
   - Establish monitoring and tracking with stakeholder communication planning

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
