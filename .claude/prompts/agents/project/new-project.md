**ðŸ¤– AGENT ACTIVATION:** This prompt automatically activates the `project-owner` agent.
**ðŸ“‹ AGENT CONTEXT:** The activated agent will read CLAUDE.md and adapt to project requirements.
**ðŸ”„ TODO INTEGRATION:** All tasks will be managed through the agent's TodoWrite workflow.

# New Project Framework Initialization

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Initialize a new project with Claude Code Multi-Agent Framework by analyzing existing project context, interactively gathering missing requirements, and automatically establishing framework configuration, directory structure, and development environment. Enable seamless integration of the framework into any existing or greenfield project while preserving existing work and adapting to detected technology patterns.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Existing Project Context Discovery
1. **Analyze current directory structure** - Detect existing project files, folders, and organization patterns
2. **Identify technology stack indicators** - Scan for package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, *.csproj, go.mod, Cargo.toml
3. **Detect existing configuration files** - Find build configs, CI/CD files, Docker files, database configs
4. **Assess project maturity** - Evaluate existing codebase size, complexity, and development stage
5. **Identify integration constraints** - Detect existing tools, frameworks, and architectural patterns

### Phase 2: Interactive Requirements Gathering
1. **Present discovered context** - Show detected technologies, structure, and project characteristics
2. **Request missing critical information** - Ask only for information that cannot be auto-detected:
   - Project name (if not evident from directory or package files)
   - Business domain (if not clear from codebase context)
   - Project scale (startup/sme/enterprise based on complexity and goals)
   - TODO management preferences (simple/hierarchical based on team size)
3. **Confirm technology stack choices** - Validate detected primary language and frameworks
4. **Gather agent preferences** - Determine which of 14 agents are needed for project scope
5. **Configure quality requirements** - Set performance, security, scalability standards based on project scale

### Phase 3: Framework Integration and Structure Creation
1. **Create CLAUDE.md configuration** - Generate framework configuration based on gathered requirements
2. **Establish .claude directory structure** - Create agents/, prompts/, docs/, templates/, hooks/ directories
3. **Generate technology-appropriate project structure** - Create directories based on detected/selected stack:
   - Frontend projects: src/, components/, assets/, public/
   - Backend projects: src/, lib/, tests/, docs/
   - Full-stack: separate frontend/backend or monorepo structure
   - Libraries: lib/, examples/, tests/, docs/
4. **Initialize development environment files** - Create appropriate config files:
   - Package management (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.)
   - Build tools (webpack.config.js, vite.config.ts, build.gradle, etc.)
   - Testing frameworks (jest.config.js, pytest.ini, etc.)
   - Code quality (eslint, prettier, pre-commit hooks)
5. **Configure version control integration** - Setup .gitignore, README.md, and framework-aware git hooks

### Phase 4: Development Environment Validation and Handoff
1. **Validate framework integration** - Test CLAUDE.md configuration completeness and agent accessibility
2. **Verify development environment** - Ensure build tools, dependencies, and tooling work correctly
3. **Test agent coordination setup** - Validate TODO management and agent communication patterns
4. **Generate initialization report** - Document what was created, configured, and next steps
5. **Provide next steps guidance** - Recommend first agents to engage and development workflow to follow

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Project Detection and Analysis Completeness
- **Technology stack accurately identified** - Primary language and frameworks correctly detected
- **Existing structure preserved** - No existing project files or directories damaged or overwritten
