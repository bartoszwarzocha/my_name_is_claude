# Project Versioning and Change Documentation Management

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Manage project versioning strategy and maintain comprehensive changelog documentation that accurately reflects development progress, feature additions, bug fixes, and breaking changes. Establish semantic versioning practices, automate version management where possible, and ensure stakeholders have clear visibility into project evolution and release planning.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Version Strategy and Change History Analysis
**Objective**: Analyze versioning requirements and implement comprehensive change history analysis and documentation

1. **Version Strategy Analysis and Planning**
   - Assess current versioning approach analyzing version numbering, tagging practices, and release patterns
   - Evaluate semantic versioning compliance determining adherence to semver principles
   - Analyze change impact patterns, plan version numbering strategy, and establish release milestone planning

2. **Change History Analysis and Documentation**
   - Parse development history extracting changes from git commits, pull requests, and issue tracking systems
   - Categorize change types classifying as features, fixes, breaking changes, or maintenance
   - Identify unreleased changes, validate change descriptions, and map changes to version increments

### Phase 2: Changelog Generation and Release Management
**Objective**: Execute changelog generation and establish comprehensive version release and communication planning

1. **Changelog Generation and Enhancement**
   - Generate structured changelog creating formatted documentation following established conventions
   - Enhance change descriptions improving clarity for different audiences
   - Add contextual information, organize for different audiences, and cross-reference with documentation

2. **Version Release and Communication Planning**
   - Plan version increment strategy determining next version number based on accumulated changes
   - Prepare release communication drafting release notes and stakeholder communications
   - Establish version tagging process, configure automated processes, and plan stakeholder notification

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Version Strategy and Change History Analysis
