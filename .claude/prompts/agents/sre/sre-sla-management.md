# SRE Service Level Agreement Management and SLO Implementation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive Service Level Agreement (SLA) frameworks with measurable SLOs and SLIs aligned with business requirements and user expectations. Create service level management systems adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with error budgets, monitoring frameworks, and operational procedures ensuring reliable service delivery across technology stacks and business domains.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: SLA Strategy and SLI Implementation
**Objective**: Analyze business requirements and implement comprehensive service level measurement framework

1. **Business Requirements and SLA Strategy Planning**
   - Read CLAUDE.md business and performance requirements to extract service level expectations, user experience targets, and business criticality
   - Analyze existing service architecture, system boundaries, dependencies, and performance characteristics with critical user journey mapping
   - Define service level framework strategy, establish SLA hierarchy, SLO categories, and measurement methodologies

2. **SLI Design and Measurement Infrastructure Implementation**
   - Design meaningful Service Level Indicators, create user-focused metrics that accurately reflect service quality and user experience
   - Implement SLI measurement infrastructure, configure monitoring, data collection, and metric calculation systems
   - Establish baseline performance characteristics, validate SLI accuracy, and create aggregation reporting systems

### Phase 2: SLO Management and Continuous Improvement
**Objective**: Execute SLO implementation and establish advanced governance capabilities

1. **SLO Design and Error Budget Implementation**
   - Define realistic Service Level Objectives, set achievable targets based on business needs, technical constraints, and user expectations
   - Implement error budget calculation systems, create automated tracking, consumption monitoring, and threshold alerting
   - Design SLO compliance monitoring, implement real-time tracking, and integrate with development processes

2. **SLA Governance and Continuous Improvement**
   - Establish SLA governance procedures, create review processes, stakeholder communication, and modification workflows
   - Implement automated alerting and escalation, configure intelligent alerting based on SLO violations and error budget consumption
   - Create SLA reporting and communication systems, design continuous improvement processes, and validate effectiveness
