4. **Establish incident war room and collaboration tools** - Configure communication channels, screen sharing, and collaborative troubleshooting
5. **Integrate monitoring with incident response tools** - Connect alerting systems with incident management platforms and runbooks

### Phase 3: Response Coordination and Resolution Procedures
1. **Implement incident response playbooks** - Create detailed procedures for common failure scenarios and troubleshooting workflows
2. **Design incident commander protocols** - Establish leadership procedures, decision-making authority, and coordination responsibilities
3. **Create rapid triage and initial assessment** - Implement quick impact assessment, scope determination, and initial containment
4. **Establish resolution tracking and communication** - Create progress updates, stakeholder communication, and status broadcasting
5. **Implement rollback and recovery procedures** - Design rapid rollback capabilities, service restoration, and validation protocols

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Analysis and Continuous Improvement
1. **Implement blameless postmortem processes** - Create comprehensive incident analysis focusing on system and process improvements
2. **Design root cause analysis procedures** - Establish methodologies for identifying underlying causes and contributing factors
3. **Create improvement action tracking** - Implement follow-up task creation, assignment, and completion tracking for incident learnings
4. **Establish knowledge management and documentation** - Create incident databases, pattern recognition, and tribal knowledge capture
5. **Design incident metrics and reporting** - Track MTTR, MTBF, and other incident response effectiveness metrics
