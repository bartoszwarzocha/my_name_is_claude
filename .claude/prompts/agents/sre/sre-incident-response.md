# SRE Incident Response Management and Crisis Resolution Procedures

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive incident response frameworks enabling rapid detection, efficient resolution, and effective communication during system outages and service degradations. Create robust incident management systems adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with escalation procedures, communication protocols, and post-incident analysis processes that minimize business impact and maximize learning from operational failures across technology stacks and business domains.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Incident Response Framework and Detection Implementation
**Objective**: Analyze incident requirements and implement comprehensive detection and response framework

1. **Incident Response Framework Design and Preparation**
   - Read CLAUDE.md incident and business requirements to extract criticality levels, escalation requirements, and business impact priorities
   - Analyze system architecture for failure modes, identify potential failure points, dependencies, and cascade failure scenarios
   - Define incident severity classification, establish response team roles, and design communication and escalation procedures

2. **Incident Detection and Alert Management Implementation**
   - Implement intelligent alerting systems, create monitoring-based detection with noise reduction and alert correlation
   - Design alert routing and notification, configure on-call schedules, escalation timers, and multi-channel notifications
   - Create incident tracking and workflow management, establish war room collaboration tools, and integrate monitoring with response platforms

### Phase 2: Response Coordination and Continuous Improvement
**Objective**: Execute response coordination and resolution and establish post-incident analysis capabilities

1. **Response Coordination and Resolution Procedures**
   - Implement incident response playbooks, create detailed procedures for common failure scenarios and troubleshooting workflows
   - Design incident commander protocols, create rapid triage and initial assessment, and establish resolution tracking communication
   - Implement rollback and recovery procedures, design rapid rollback capabilities, service restoration, and validation protocols

2. **Post-Incident Analysis and Continuous Improvement**
   - Implement blameless postmortem processes, create comprehensive incident analysis focusing on system and process improvements
   - Design root cause analysis procedures, create improvement action tracking, and establish knowledge management documentation
   - Design incident metrics and reporting, track MTTR, MTBF, and other response effectiveness metrics
