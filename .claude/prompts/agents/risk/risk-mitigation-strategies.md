3. **Implement hedging strategies and financial risk management** - Design financial instruments, hedging mechanisms, and economic risk protection
4. **Establish business partnership and risk sharing arrangements** - Create strategic partnerships, joint ventures, and collaborative risk management
5. **Configure diversification strategies and portfolio risk management** - Implement business diversification, geographic spread, and concentration risk reduction

### Phase 4: Advanced Risk Management and Continuous Optimization
1. **Implement integrated risk management and holistic coordination** - Create enterprise-wide risk coordination, interdependency management, and system-wide optimization
2. **Design adaptive risk management and dynamic adjustment** - Configure responsive mitigation, strategy adaptation, and changing risk environment management
3. **Create risk culture and awareness integration** - Implement risk training, awareness programs, and behavioral risk management
4. **Establish continuous improvement and mitigation optimization** - Design feedback loops, strategy refinement, and mitigation effectiveness enhancement
5. **Configure crisis management and emergency response integration** - Implement crisis preparedness, emergency procedures, and business continuity coordination
