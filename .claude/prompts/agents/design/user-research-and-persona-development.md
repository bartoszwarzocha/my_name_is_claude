- **Timeline and resource** allocation planning

### Step 2: Research Methods

**Qualitative Research:**
- **User interviews** (30-60 minutes, 5-8 participants per segment)
- **Focus groups** for group dynamics and feature discussions
- **Contextual inquiries** observing users in their environment
- **Diary studies** for longitudinal behavior understanding

**Quantitative Research:**
- **Surveys** for broad user preference and behavior data

- Work environment, tools currently used
- Goals, motivations, and pain points
- Device usage patterns and preferences

**Behavioral Patterns:**
- Current workflows and task sequences
- Frequency and duration of tool usage
- Collaboration and communication preferences
- Learning styles and onboarding preferences

**Needs and Frustrations:**
- Job-to-be-done and desired outcomes
- Current solution limitations and workarounds
