# Monitoring Intelligent Alerting Systems and Notification Management

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement intelligent alerting systems providing actionable notifications about system issues, performance degradations, and business impacts while minimizing alert fatigue and false positives. Create comprehensive alert management adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with alert rules, escalation procedures, notification channels, and alert correlation enabling rapid incident response across technology stacks and operational environments.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Alert Strategy Design and Rules Implementation
**Objective**: Analyze alerting requirements and implement comprehensive alert rules and threshold management

1. **Alert Strategy Design and Business Impact Assessment**
   - Read CLAUDE.md alerting requirements to extract alert priorities, escalation needs, and business impact criteria
   - Analyze system critical paths, failure modes, identify essential services, user journeys, and potential failure scenarios
   - Define alert severity classification, establish alerting philosophy, noise reduction, and map requirements to monitoring data

2. **Alert Rules Design and Threshold Management**
   - Implement intelligent threshold-based alerting, create static and dynamic thresholds based on historical data and requirements
   - Design anomaly detection, machine learning alerts, create composite and correlation-based alerts for accurate issue detection
   - Establish alert timing, persistence logic, implement alert context, and enrichment with troubleshooting information

### Phase 2: Notification Systems and Alert Optimization
**Objective**: Execute notification and escalation systems and establish comprehensive alert optimization capabilities

1. **Notification Channels and Escalation Implementation**
   - Configure multi-channel notification systems, implement email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty integration
   - Design on-call management, rotation, implement intelligent routing, escalation based on expertise and availability
   - Create notification customization, preferences, design alert acknowledgment, and resolution tracking

2. **Alert Management and Continuous Optimization**
   - Implement alert correlation, suppression, create alert effectiveness measurement, track accuracy and response times
   - Design alert feedback, optimization loops, implement alert analytics, reporting for trends and performance
   - Establish alert governance, maintenance procedures, create processes for rule management and continuous improvement
