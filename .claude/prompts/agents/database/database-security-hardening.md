# Database Security Hardening and Access Control Implementation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive database security hardening strategies protecting sensitive data, enforcing access controls, and maintaining regulatory compliance. Create systematic security frameworks adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with authentication, authorization, encryption, monitoring, and compliance supporting enterprise data protection across database platforms and regulatory environments.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Security Assessment and Access Control Implementation
**Objective**: Analyze security requirements and implement comprehensive access control

1. **Security Assessment and Hardening Strategy Planning**
   - Read CLAUDE.md security requirements to extract data protection needs, regulatory obligations, and security standards
   - Conduct security assessment, define security strategy, and establish policy framework with compliance requirements
   - Design security monitoring framework with threat detection, incident response, and protection mechanisms

2. **Access Control and Authentication Implementation**
   - Configure user authentication, role-based access control, and implement database user management
   - Establish connection security, application security integration, and configure service accounts
   - Create strong authentication, role hierarchy, secure connections, network isolation, and API security

### Phase 2: Data Protection and Security Monitoring
**Objective**: Execute data protection and establish comprehensive security monitoring

1. **Data Encryption and Protection Implementation**
   - Implement data encryption, key management, and configure data masking with tokenization
   - Implement database activity monitoring, data loss prevention, and establish leakage protection
   - Create transparent encryption, cryptographic security, audit trails, access logging, and unauthorized access prevention

2. **Security Monitoring and Compliance Management**
   - Implement real-time security monitoring, compliance automation, and design vulnerability management
   - Establish incident response capabilities, continuous security improvement, and configure assessment cycles
   - Create anomaly detection, automated compliance checking, vulnerability scanning, and security review processes
