4. **Generate DbContext with optimized configuration** - Create database context with proper entity sets, connection management, and performance settings
5. **Implement custom value converters and type handlers** - Handle complex data types, enums, and custom business logic requirements

### Phase 3: Business Logic Integration and Optimization
1. **Implement repository and unit of work patterns** - Create data access abstractions supporting clean architecture and testability
2. **Generate query optimization and performance enhancements** - Implement efficient querying patterns, lazy loading strategies, and performance monitoring
3. **Create database migration and versioning support** - Generate migration scripts and version control integration for schema evolution
4. **Implement validation and business rule enforcement** - Add entity validation, business rule constraints, and data integrity checks
5. **Design caching and performance optimization strategies** - Implement query result caching and performance optimization patterns

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation Excellence
1. **Generate comprehensive unit and integration tests** - Create test suites covering entity mapping, relationships, and business logic validation
2. **Create documentation and usage guides** - Generate entity documentation, relationship diagrams, and usage examples
3. **Implement monitoring and performance tracking** - Add performance monitoring, query analysis, and optimization feedback systems
4. **Establish maintenance and evolution procedures** - Create procedures for schema changes, entity updates, and performance optimization
5. **Enable team collaboration and development workflows** - Provide development guidelines, code review standards, and contribution processes
