# Database Schema to Entity Framework Generation Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Generate comprehensive Entity Framework models and configurations from existing database schemas maintaining data integrity, optimizing performance, and supporting business logic requirements. Create type-safe, maintainable ORM mappings adapted to CLAUDE.md technology stack with preserved database relationships.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Schema Analysis and Entity Generation
**Objective**: Analyze database structure and generate comprehensive Entity Framework models

1. **Database Schema Analysis and Architecture Planning**
   - Analyze existing database schema to discover tables, relationships, constraints, and performance patterns
   - Identify entity relationships and domain patterns for object-oriented mapping strategies
   - Plan Entity Framework architecture with DbContext structure and mapping configurations

2. **Entity Model Generation and Configuration**
   - Generate strongly-typed entity classes with proper type mapping and relationship configurations
   - Implement navigation properties, data annotations, and fluent API configurations
   - Create optimized DbContext with entity sets, connection management, and custom value converters

### Phase 2: Business Integration and Production Excellence
**Objective**: Implement business logic integration and ensure production readiness

1. **Business Logic Integration and Performance Optimization**
   - Implement repository and unit of work patterns supporting clean architecture and testability
   - Generate query optimization, lazy loading strategies, and database migration support
   - Add entity validation, business rule enforcement, and caching optimization strategies

2. **Testing and Operational Excellence**
   - Generate comprehensive unit and integration tests covering entity mapping and business logic
   - Create documentation, usage guides, and performance monitoring with tracking systems
   - Establish maintenance procedures, schema evolution support, and team collaboration workflows

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA

### Entity Generation and Mapping Excellence
**Schema Accuracy and Type Safety**: Entity classes accurately reflect database schema with proper type mapping and nullability, comprehensive relationship mapping with navigation properties, strong typing with validation attributes and performance optimizations

**Code Quality and Conventions**: Consistent code generation conventions with proper naming, file organization, and established patterns

### Business Integration and Operational Excellence
**Architecture and Business Logic**: Repository and service patterns supporting clean architecture, effective business rule enforcement with entity validation, robust transaction management with migration and versioning support

**Testing and Operations**: Comprehensive test coverage for entity operations, complete documentation with performance monitoring, established maintenance procedures and functional team collaboration workflows

## 4. ðŸ“š USAGE EXAMPLES

**Cross-Domain Entity Framework Examples**

**Enterprise ERP System**: Complex multi-table entity relationships with inheritance hierarchies, separate DbContext for business modules, query optimization for reporting, and repository patterns with transaction management

**E-commerce Platform**: High-performance product catalog entities with caching integration, read-only entities for browsing, write-optimized order processing, and real-time inventory tracking with notification integration

**Healthcare HIPAA System**: Security-first encrypted entity design with audit trails, clinical data models for patient records, HIPAA compliance features, and HL7 FHIR entity mapping standards

**Financial Trading Platform**: High-frequency optimized trading entities with real-time updates, risk management models with compliance monitoring, audit trail entities, and minimal overhead configurations

**SaaS Multi-Tenant Platform**: Tenant-aware base entities with data isolation strategies, tenant-specific DbContext configurations, resource usage tracking models, and administrative provisioning support
