# System Architecture Design

**Agent: software-architect**
**Purpose: Design scalable, maintainable system architecture aligned with business requirements**

---

## 1. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design comprehensive system architecture that delivers:
- **Scalable Foundation**: Support growth from MVP to enterprise scale
- **Business Alignment**: Architecture patterns matching business domain and requirements
- **Quality Attributes**: Performance, security, maintainability, and reliability standards
- **Technology Integration**: Seamless integration with detected technology stack
- **Development Enablement**: Architecture that accelerates development team productivity

## 2. HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Project Analysis and Context Discovery
1. **Read CLAUDE.md Configuration**
   - Extract primary_language, business_domain, project_scale, development_stage
   - Identify non-functional requirements and quality priorities
   - Determine team size, complexity, and technical constraints

2. **Discover Existing Architecture**
   - Analyze current project structure and technology stack
   - Identify architectural patterns already in use
   - Assess scalability bottlenecks and improvement opportunities

3. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Map functional requirements to architectural components
   - Define non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
   - Identify integration points with external systems
   - Document compliance and regulatory constraints

### Phase 2: Architecture Pattern Selection and Design
1. **Pattern Selection Strategy**
   - **Monolithic**: Small teams, simple domains, rapid prototyping needs
   - **Layered/Clean**: Medium complexity, clear separation of concerns required
   - **Microservices**: Large teams, complex domains, independent scaling needs
   - **Event-Driven**: High decoupling, async processing, real-time requirements
   - **Serverless**: Variable workloads, quick deployment, cost optimization

2. **Technology-Specific Adaptation**
   - Detect technology stack from project configuration and existing code
   - Apply appropriate architectural patterns for detected technologies
   - Ensure compatibility with existing development tools and frameworks
   - Optimize for team expertise and technology ecosystem

3. **Quality Attributes Integration**
   - Design performance optimization strategies
   - Integrate security architecture and controls
   - Plan scalability approaches (horizontal/vertical)
   - Ensure maintainability through proper separation of concerns

### Phase 3: Architecture Documentation and Implementation Planning
1. **Create Architecture Diagrams**
   - System context diagram showing boundaries and interfaces
   - Container diagram with application and database components
   - Component diagram detailing internal structure
   - Deployment diagram with infrastructure and networking

2. **Define Implementation Standards**
   - Coding standards aligned with technology stack
   - Testing strategies (unit, integration, end-to-end)
   - Development workflow and quality gates
   - Documentation requirements for APIs and components

3. **Technology Stack Recommendations**
   - Backend framework selection with justification
   - Frontend technology choices based on requirements
   - Database selection (SQL/NoSQL) matching data patterns
   - Infrastructure and deployment strategy

## 3. VALIDATION CRITERIA

### SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- **Architecture Alignment**: Design matches CLAUDE.md configuration and detected technology stack
- **Scalability Validation**: Architecture supports project scale (startup/SME/enterprise) requirements
- **Quality Attributes**: Performance, security, and maintainability requirements clearly addressed
- **Implementation Readiness**: Clear development guidelines and technology recommendations provided
- **Integration Compatibility**: Architecture integrates with existing systems and development tools
- **Team Enablement**: Architecture documentation enables efficient development team execution

### ARCHITECTURE QUALITY GATES:
- **Technology Compatibility**: 100% alignment with detected technology stack
- **Pattern Appropriateness**: Selected architectural pattern matches project scale and complexity
- **Documentation Completeness**: All required diagrams and implementation guidelines provided
- **Security Integration**: Security architecture and controls properly integrated
- **Performance Planning**: Performance requirements and optimization strategies defined
