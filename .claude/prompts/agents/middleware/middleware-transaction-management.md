# Transaction Management and Distributed Processing Coordination

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive transaction management architectures ensuring data consistency, coordinating distributed operations, and maintaining ACID properties across enterprise systems. Create transaction frameworks adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with distributed transactions, compensation patterns, concurrency control, and data consistency supporting reliable business operations across technology stacks.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Transaction Architecture and Distributed Implementation
**Objective**: Analyze transaction requirements and implement comprehensive distributed transaction coordination

1. **Transaction Architecture Analysis and Consistency Requirements Planning**
   - Read CLAUDE.md transaction requirements to extract consistency objectives, transaction patterns, and distributed processing needs
   - Analyze current system transaction patterns, map existing boundaries, consistency requirements, and distributed complexity
   - Define transaction management strategy, establish transaction standards, consistency protocols, and design infrastructure framework

2. **Distributed Transaction Implementation and Coordination Mechanisms**
   - Configure distributed transaction coordinators, two-phase commit, implement transaction managers, and coordinator setup
   - Design compensation patterns, saga implementation, implement concurrency control, and locking strategies
   - Establish transaction boundaries, resource coordination, configure monitoring, and performance tracking

### Phase 2: Data Consistency Implementation and Advanced Optimization
**Objective**: Execute data consistency implementation and establish advanced transaction capabilities

1. **Data Consistency and Conflict Resolution Implementation**
   - Create eventual consistency patterns, conflict resolution, implement asynchronous consistency, and detection strategies
   - Design data synchronization, replication coordination, implement transaction recovery, and failure handling
   - Establish cross-system data consistency, multi-database transactions, configure security, and access control

2. **Advanced Transaction Patterns and Performance Optimization**
   - Implement event sourcing, temporal consistency patterns, create event-driven transactions, and audit trails
   - Design transaction batching, bulk processing optimization, create distributed consensus, and coordination algorithms
   - Establish transaction federation, multi-cluster coordination, design performance monitoring, and optimization cycles
