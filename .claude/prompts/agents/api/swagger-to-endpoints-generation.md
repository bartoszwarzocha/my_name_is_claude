# API Endpoint Generation from OpenAPI Specifications

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Generate complete, production-ready API endpoints from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications maintaining specification accuracy, implementing proper validation, error handling, and business logic patterns. Create backend implementations adapted to CLAUDE.md technology stack ensuring type safety, security compliance, and seamless integration with existing application architecture.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Specification Analysis and Code Generation
**Objective**: Analyze OpenAPI specifications and generate comprehensive backend implementation

1. **OpenAPI Specification Analysis and Validation**
   - Parse and validate OpenAPI specification structure with schema compliance and generation requirements
   - Extract endpoint definitions, data models, security requirements, and business logic workflow patterns
   - Analyze target backend framework requirements based on CLAUDE.md configuration

2. **Technology Stack Adaptation and Code Generation**
   - Generate controller/route implementations with HTTP method mapping and parameter binding
   - Implement request/response models with data transfer objects and validation attributes
   - Create service layer integrations and implement authentication/authorization with security middleware

### Phase 2: Validation Integration and Quality Assurance
**Objective**: Implement validation, testing, and maintenance excellence

1. **Validation, Error Handling, and Integration**
   - Implement comprehensive input validation with standardized error handling and status code management
   - Generate API testing and documentation with specification-code synchronization
   - Implement logging, monitoring integration, and deployment configuration management

2. **Quality Assurance and Maintenance Excellence**
   - Establish specification-code synchronization with automated validation ensuring OpenAPI compliance
   - Create comprehensive testing strategies and implement performance optimization with database queries
   - Establish documentation processes and enable continuous integration with CI/CD pipeline integration
