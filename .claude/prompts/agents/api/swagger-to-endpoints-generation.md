# API Endpoint Generation from OpenAPI Specifications

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Generate complete, production-ready API endpoints from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications that maintain specification accuracy, implement proper validation, error handling, and business logic patterns. Create backend implementations that adapt to the technology stack specified in CLAUDE.md while ensuring type safety, security compliance, and seamless integration with existing application architecture.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: OpenAPI Specification Analysis and Validation
1. **Parse and validate OpenAPI specification** - Analyze specification structure, validate schema compliance, and identify generation requirements
2. **Extract endpoint definitions and patterns** - Catalog all paths, methods, parameters, request/response schemas, and security requirements
3. **Analyze data models and relationships** - Identify all schema definitions, data types, validation rules, and object relationships
4. **Assess authentication and security requirements** - Extract security schemes, authorization patterns, and compliance requirements
5. **Identify business logic and workflow patterns** - Understand endpoint groupings, dependencies, and business process implementations

### Phase 2: Technology Stack Adaptation and Code Generation
1. **Analyze target backend framework requirements** - Determine appropriate patterns, libraries, and architecture based on CLAUDE.md configuration
2. **Generate controller/route implementations** - Create endpoint handlers with proper HTTP method mapping, parameter binding, and response formatting
3. **Implement request/response models** - Generate data transfer objects, validation attributes, and serialization configurations
4. **Create service layer integrations** - Generate service interfaces and business logic placeholders aligned with application architecture
5. **Implement authentication and authorization** - Generate security middleware, authentication handlers, and authorization policies

### Phase 3: Validation, Error Handling, and Integration
1. **Implement comprehensive input validation** - Generate validation logic for parameters, request bodies, and business rules
2. **Create standardized error handling** - Implement error response patterns, exception handling, and status code management
3. **Generate API testing and documentation** - Create unit tests, integration tests, and maintain specification-code synchronization
4. **Implement logging and monitoring integration** - Generate logging patterns, performance tracking, and operational observability
5. **Create deployment and configuration management** - Generate environment-specific configurations and deployment scripts

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance and Maintenance Excellence
1. **Establish specification-code synchronization** - Implement automated validation ensuring generated code matches OpenAPI specification
2. **Create comprehensive testing strategies** - Generate test suites covering all endpoints, error cases, and business scenarios
3. **Implement performance optimization** - Generate optimized database queries, caching strategies, and resource management
4. **Establish documentation and maintenance processes** - Create developer documentation, API guides, and change management procedures
5. **Enable continuous integration and deployment** - Integrate generation process with CI/CD pipeline for automated updates
