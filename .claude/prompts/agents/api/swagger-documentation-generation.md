# API Documentation Generation and OpenAPI Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Generate comprehensive, interactive API documentation serving as the definitive source of truth for API consumers and developers. Create OpenAPI 3.0 compliant documentation with complete endpoint coverage, detailed schemas, realistic examples, and interactive testing capabilities adapted to CLAUDE.md backend technology stack.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: API Discovery and OpenAPI Generation
**Objective**: Analyze API structure and generate comprehensive OpenAPI documentation

1. **API Discovery and Analysis**
   - Analyze backend codebase structure to discover API controllers, routes, endpoints, and service layers
   - Extract data models and schemas including DTOs, validation rules, and data relationships
   - Discover authentication patterns, security implementations, and API versioning strategies

2. **OpenAPI Specification Generation**
   - Create comprehensive OpenAPI 3.0 structure with metadata, server configurations, and tag organization
   - Document all endpoints with detailed descriptions including business logic and usage examples
   - Generate complete schema definitions with validation rules and standardized error response documentation

### Phase 2: Interactive Documentation and Maintenance Excellence
**Objective**: Implement interactive capabilities and establish maintenance workflows

1. **Interactive Documentation and Examples**
   - Generate realistic request/response examples covering typical and edge case scenarios
   - Implement interactive testing capabilities enabling API exploration through documentation interface
   - Create client SDK generation support and code sample generation for popular programming languages

2. **Maintenance and Integration Excellence**
   - Establish automated documentation generation integrated with CI/CD pipeline for automatic updates
   - Create documentation validation and testing with version management and changelog integration
   - Implement feedback collection and quality monitoring for continuous documentation enhancement

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
