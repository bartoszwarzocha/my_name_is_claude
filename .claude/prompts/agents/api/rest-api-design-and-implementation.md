# REST API Design and Implementation Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement scalable, secure REST APIs that serve as the backbone for applications and external integrations. Create robust API architecture following RESTful principles, industry standards, and framework-specific best practices. Ensure comprehensive API documentation, security implementation, performance optimization, and seamless integration capabilities while adapting to detected technology stack and project requirements.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: API Requirements Analysis and Architecture Planning
1. **Analyze business domain and functional requirements** - Extract business entities, workflows, and integration needs from architecture specifications
2. **Assess performance and scalability requirements** - Define load expectations, response time targets, and throughput requirements
3. **Evaluate security and compliance requirements** - Determine authentication, authorization, and regulatory compliance needs
4. **Identify integration patterns** - Plan external system integrations, frontend coordination, and microservice architecture
5. **Select appropriate architectural patterns** - Choose between monolithic, microservices, or serverless approaches based on project scale

### Phase 2: RESTful API Contract Design and Resource Modeling
1. **Design resource-oriented API structure** - Model business entities as API resources with proper URL hierarchies and relationships
2. **Define comprehensive HTTP method mappings** - Implement standard CRUD operations with appropriate HTTP verbs and status codes
3. **Create consistent request and response schemas** - Design JSON structures with validation rules and error handling patterns
4. **Plan API versioning and backward compatibility** - Establish versioning strategy and migration paths for API evolution
5. **Design pagination, filtering, and search capabilities** - Implement efficient data retrieval patterns with proper query parameters

### Phase 3: Technology-Adaptive Implementation Strategy
1. **Detect and adapt to project technology stack** - Analyze CLAUDE.md configuration for backend framework, database, and integration requirements
2. **Apply framework-specific architectural patterns** - Implement appropriate design patterns based on detected technology (MVC, Clean Architecture, etc.)
3. **Implement data access and persistence layer** - Design repository patterns, ORM integration, and database optimization strategies
4. **Create comprehensive validation and error handling** - Implement input validation, business rule enforcement, and standardized error responses
5. **Integrate security and authentication mechanisms** - Implement authentication, authorization, and security controls appropriate for project requirements

### Phase 4: API Quality, Documentation, and Integration Excellence
1. **Generate comprehensive API documentation** - Create OpenAPI/Swagger specifications with interactive documentation and testing capabilities
2. **Implement monitoring and observability** - Add logging, metrics collection, health checks, and distributed tracing for production readiness
3. **Create automated testing suite** - Develop unit tests, integration tests, contract tests, and performance tests for continuous quality assurance
4. **Validate API security and compliance** - Conduct security testing, vulnerability assessments, and compliance validation based on project requirements
5. **Establish deployment and maintenance procedures** - Create deployment pipelines, monitoring dashboards, and maintenance workflows for production operations

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
