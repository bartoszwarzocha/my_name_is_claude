4. **Create custom scalar types and directives** - Implement domain-specific data types and schema enhancement directives
5. **Establish caching strategies** - Design query result caching, resolver-level caching, and CDN integration

### Phase 3: Advanced GraphQL Features and Performance Optimization
1. **Implement subscription and real-time capabilities** - Design WebSocket-based subscriptions for live data updates
2. **Create GraphQL federation architecture** - Implement schema stitching and federated gateway patterns for microservices
3. **Optimize query complexity and security** - Implement query depth limiting, complexity analysis, and rate limiting
4. **Design authorization and authentication** - Integrate field-level security, role-based access control, and data privacy
5. **Implement monitoring and observability** - Create query performance tracking, error monitoring, and usage analytics

### Phase 4: Integration, Testing, and Developer Experience
1. **Generate comprehensive API documentation** - Create interactive GraphQL playground and schema documentation
2. **Implement comprehensive testing strategy** - Design unit tests for resolvers, integration tests, and query validation
3. **Create client integration tools** - Generate TypeScript types, SDK libraries, and code generation tools
4. **Establish deployment and operational readiness** - Plan deployment configurations, health checks, and monitoring dashboards
5. **Enable team collaboration workflows** - Provide schema sharing, version control integration, and development tooling
