# GraphQL API Development and Schema Design Excellence

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement efficient GraphQL APIs providing flexible data fetching capabilities with advanced features including subscriptions, caching, federation, and performance optimization. Create type-safe, scalable GraphQL architecture that supports complex queries, real-time data synchronization, and seamless integration with existing systems while maintaining security, performance, and developer experience excellence.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Schema Architecture and Advanced Features
**Objective**: Design comprehensive GraphQL schema and implement advanced capabilities

1. **Schema Design and Type System**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md requirements to model business entities as GraphQL types with relationships and computed fields
   - Create schema-first architecture with comprehensive type definitions, query/mutation operations, and subscription patterns
   - Establish schema governance with versioning strategy and backward compatibility protocols

2. **Advanced GraphQL Implementation**
   - Implement efficient resolver patterns with DataLoader for N+1 optimization and caching strategies
   - Create WebSocket-based subscriptions for real-time capabilities and GraphQL federation for microservices
   - Optimize query complexity with depth limiting, implement field-level security and role-based access control

### Phase 2: Integration and Developer Experience
**Objective**: Integrate with existing systems and establish comprehensive developer experience

1. **Data Layer Integration and Performance**
   - Integrate GraphQL layer with databases, REST APIs, and microservices using optimized data fetching patterns
   - Implement custom scalar types, directives, and comprehensive caching with CDN integration
   - Create monitoring and observability with query performance tracking and error analysis

2. **Developer Experience and Operations**
   - Generate interactive GraphQL playground, schema documentation, and TypeScript types with SDK libraries
   - Implement comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests, integration tests, and query validation
   - Establish deployment configurations, health checks, and team collaboration workflows with version control integration

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
