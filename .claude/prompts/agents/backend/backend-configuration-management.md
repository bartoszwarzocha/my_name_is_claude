# Backend Configuration Management and Environment Orchestration

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive configuration management systems for backend services that handle environment-specific settings, secrets management, feature flags, and deployment configurations. Create secure, scalable configuration infrastructure adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements, supporting multiple environments, dynamic configuration updates, and compliance requirements across different technology stacks and deployment scenarios.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Configuration Architecture and Security Implementation
**Objective**: Design comprehensive configuration management with secure secrets handling

1. **Configuration Strategy and Environment Management**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md deployment and security requirements to design configuration hierarchy with environment-specific overrides
   - Implement configuration validation with schema management, type checking, and environment isolation boundaries
   - Create efficient configuration loading with caching strategies, versioning, and rollback capabilities

2. **Secrets Management and Security Controls**
   - Implement secure secrets storage with encryption, access control, and rotation capabilities for API keys and credentials
   - Configure certificate and cryptographic key management with SSL certificates and signing key lifecycle
   - Create secure runtime secrets injection without exposing sensitive data and comprehensive audit logging

### Phase 2: Dynamic Configuration and Operational Excellence
**Objective**: Implement feature management, monitoring, and operational procedures

1. **Feature Management and Dynamic Updates**
   - Implement feature flag and toggle systems for dynamic feature control, A/B testing, and gradual rollouts
   - Design runtime configuration updates with hot reloading, dynamic parameter updates, and zero-downtime changes
   - Create configuration monitoring with change tracking, validation alerts, and compliance monitoring

2. **Backup, Recovery, and Operational Reliability**
   - Implement configuration backup strategies, disaster recovery procedures, and consistency validation
   - Validate configuration management effectiveness with automated testing, security control validation, and operational reliability
   - Create comprehensive change management procedures with audit trails and security compliance tracking

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
