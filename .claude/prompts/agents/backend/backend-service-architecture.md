# Backend Service Architecture Design and Implementation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement scalable, maintainable backend service architectures adapted to project requirements defined in CLAUDE.md. Create comprehensive backend systems that support business logic, data persistence, external integrations, and operational requirements while ensuring performance, security, and maintainability across different technology stacks and business domains.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Architecture Analysis and Technology Stack Discovery
1. **Read CLAUDE.md project configuration** - Extract backend technologies, business domain, scalability requirements, and integration needs
2. **Analyze existing backend structure** - Discover current architecture patterns, technology choices, and system boundaries
3. **Identify service boundaries** - Define microservices, monolith structure, or hybrid architecture based on project scale and complexity
4. **Assess performance requirements** - Determine throughput, latency, and scalability needs based on business domain and user expectations
5. **Evaluate integration requirements** - Identify external APIs, message queues, databases, and third-party service dependencies

### Phase 2: Service Architecture Design and Pattern Selection
1. **Define service architecture patterns** - Select appropriate patterns (layered, hexagonal, microservices, event-driven) based on requirements
2. **Design data access patterns** - Implement repository, active record, or domain-driven design patterns for data management
3. **Create API layer architecture** - Design REST, GraphQL, or RPC interfaces with proper error handling and validation
4. **Implement business logic organization** - Structure domain services, use cases, and business rules for maintainability
5. **Design cross-cutting concerns** - Handle authentication, authorization, logging, monitoring, and error management consistently

### Phase 3: Technology-Specific Implementation and Integration
1. **Implement technology-specific patterns** - Apply framework conventions (Spring Boot, Express.js, FastAPI, ASP.NET) appropriately
2. **Configure dependency injection** - Set up service containers, dependency management, and component lifecycle
3. **Integrate data persistence layer** - Configure ORM/ODM, database connections, migrations, and data access optimization
4. **Implement external service integration** - Handle HTTP clients, message queues, caching layers, and third-party APIs
5. **Configure operational concerns** - Set up health checks, metrics collection, logging, and deployment configuration

### Phase 4: Performance, Security, and Quality Implementation
1. **Implement performance optimizations** - Configure caching strategies, connection pooling, and resource management
2. **Apply security patterns** - Implement authentication, authorization, input validation, and data protection measures
3. **Create testing strategies** - Implement unit tests, integration tests, and contract testing for service reliability
4. **Configure monitoring and observability** - Set up application metrics, health endpoints, and operational monitoring
5. **Validate architecture compliance** - Ensure implementation follows established patterns and meets quality standards
