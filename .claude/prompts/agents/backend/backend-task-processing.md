# Backend Asynchronous Task Processing and Job Queue Management

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement robust asynchronous task processing systems for backend services that handle background jobs, scheduled tasks, and long-running operations without blocking user-facing requests. Create scalable job processing infrastructure adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements, supporting various task types, priority management, error handling, and monitoring across different technology stacks and operational scales.
