# Backend Monitoring, Logging, and Observability Implementation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and observability systems for backend services that provide real-time visibility into system health, performance, and business metrics. Create robust observability infrastructure adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements, enabling proactive issue detection, debugging capabilities, compliance logging, and operational insights across different technology stacks and deployment environments.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Observability Strategy and Logging Implementation
**Objective**: Design comprehensive observability infrastructure and implement structured logging systems

1. **Observability Requirements and Strategy Design**
   - Analyze CLAUDE.md monitoring and compliance requirements to extract operational needs and business metric requirements
   - Assess existing monitoring infrastructure and identify observability gaps in current logging systems
   - Define monitoring objectives with SLAs, service level indicators, error budgets, and performance targets

2. **Structured Logging and Log Management**
   - Implement structured logging architecture with consistent log formats, correlation IDs, and contextual information
   - Configure log levels, filtering rules, and log aggregation with centralized collection and searchability
   - Create application and business event logging with user actions, security events, and compliance-driven retention

### Phase 2: Performance Monitoring and Advanced Observability
**Objective**: Implement comprehensive performance monitoring and advanced operational intelligence

1. **Application Performance Monitoring and Metrics**
   - Implement application metrics collection with custom metrics, performance counters, and business KPI tracking
   - Configure distributed tracing across microservices with health checks and intelligent alerting systems
   - Create real-time dashboards with operational visualization and system status displays

2. **Advanced Observability and Operational Intelligence**
   - Implement error tracking with aggregation, root cause analysis, and performance profiling with diagnostics
   - Create security and audit logging with authentication events and compliance reporting
   - Design capacity planning with usage analytics, growth projections, and monitoring effectiveness validation
