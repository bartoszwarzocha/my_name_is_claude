# Backend Authentication and Authorization Systems Implementation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive authentication and authorization systems for backend services that ensure secure user access, session management, and resource protection. Create scalable identity management solutions adapted to project requirements from CLAUDE.md, supporting various authentication methods, authorization patterns, and security compliance requirements across different technology stacks and business domains.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Security Requirements Analysis and Technology Discovery
1. **Read CLAUDE.md security and business requirements** - Extract authentication needs, compliance requirements, and user management complexity
2. **Analyze existing security infrastructure** - Discover current authentication systems, user stores, and authorization patterns
3. **Identify authentication methods required** - Determine password-based, multi-factor, social login, or enterprise SSO needs
4. **Assess authorization complexity** - Evaluate role-based, attribute-based, or custom authorization requirements
5. **Evaluate compliance and audit requirements** - Identify regulatory compliance needs (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX) and audit trail requirements

### Phase 2: Authentication Architecture Design and Token Strategy
1. **Design authentication flows** - Create login, registration, password recovery, and session management workflows
2. **Select token and session strategies** - Implement JWT, session cookies, refresh tokens, or hybrid approaches based on requirements
3. **Configure multi-factor authentication** - Design TOTP, SMS, email, or hardware token integration for enhanced security
4. **Implement social and enterprise login** - Integrate OAuth2/OpenID providers, SAML, or enterprise identity systems
5. **Design password and credential management** - Create secure password storage, complexity requirements, and rotation policies

### Phase 3: Authorization Framework and Access Control Implementation
1. **Implement role-based access control (RBAC)** - Create user roles, permissions, and resource access management systems
2. **Design attribute-based authorization** - Implement context-aware access control based on user attributes, resource properties, and environmental factors
3. **Create API-level authorization** - Implement middleware and decorators for endpoint-level access control and permission validation
4. **Design resource-level permissions** - Create fine-grained access control for data records, file access, and feature availability
5. **Implement permission inheritance and delegation** - Handle complex organizational structures and temporary access grants

### Phase 4: Security Integration and Operational Excellence
1. **Integrate security monitoring and logging** - Implement authentication attempt logging, suspicious activity detection, and security event tracking
2. **Configure rate limiting and brute force protection** - Create account lockout policies, IP-based restrictions, and API rate limiting
3. **Implement secure session management** - Handle session lifecycle, concurrent sessions, and secure session termination
4. **Create security testing and validation** - Implement authentication flow testing, authorization rule validation, and security compliance checks
5. **Configure operational security features** - Set up security monitoring, incident response integration, and compliance reporting

## 3. âœ… VALIDATION CRITERIA
