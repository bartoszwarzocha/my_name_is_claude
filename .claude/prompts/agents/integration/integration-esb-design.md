# Enterprise Service Bus Design and Implementation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) architectures enabling seamless integration between distributed systems, applications, and services. Create ESB frameworks adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with message routing, protocol transformation, service orchestration, and enterprise application integration supporting scalable business operations across technology stacks.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: ESB Architecture and Integration Implementation
**Objective**: Analyze integration landscape and implement comprehensive ESB architecture

1. **ESB Architecture Analysis and Integration Landscape Mapping**
   - Read CLAUDE.md integration requirements to extract ESB objectives, service integration needs, and connectivity patterns
   - Analyze existing system landscape, map current applications, data flows, and integration complexity
   - Define ESB strategy, establish integration protocols, message standards, and design infrastructure architecture

2. **Message Routing and Service Orchestration Implementation**
   - Implement intelligent message routing, mediation, content-based routing, and protocol adaptation
   - Design service orchestration, workflow management, configure service registry, and endpoint management
   - Establish message transformation, data mapping, implement integration security, and access control

### Phase 2: Enterprise Integration and ESB Operations
**Objective**: Execute enterprise application integration and establish comprehensive ESB operations

1. **Enterprise Application Integration and Service Virtualization**
   - Create enterprise application integration patterns with EAI adapters and legacy system connectivity
   - Design service virtualization, abstraction layers, implement integration monitoring, and management
   - Establish error handling, message reliability, configure load balancing, and high availability

2. **ESB Governance and Continuous Integration Operations**
   - Establish integration governance, policy enforcement, implement ESB analytics, and performance optimization
   - Create integration testing, validation frameworks, design change management, and version control
   - Establish continuous improvement, ESB evolution, feedback loops, and architecture optimization
