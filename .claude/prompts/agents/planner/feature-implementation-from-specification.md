# Feature Implementation from Specification Excellence

**Agent: product-manager**
**Purpose: Implement complete features from specification documents with technology-adaptive patterns and coordinated development**

---

## 1. üéØ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Implement complete application features based on detailed specification documents, coordinating across frontend, backend, and data layers to deliver production-ready functionality. Create comprehensive feature implementation processes that meet all business requirements, user experience standards, and technical specifications while adapting to the technology stack and business domain specified in CLAUDE.md.

## 2. üîÑ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Specification Analysis and Implementation Planning
**Objective**: Analyze specifications and design comprehensive implementation strategy with cross-team coordination

1. **Specification Analysis and Requirements Extraction**
   - Parse business requirements, user stories, and technical specifications from documentation
   - Decompose features into manageable frontend, backend, and data layer components
   - Identify dependencies, integration points, and cross-component communication requirements

2. **Architecture Planning and Team Coordination**
   - Design feature architecture aligned with existing system and technology stack
   - Create detailed task breakdown with team assignments and clear deliverables
   - Establish communication protocols and comprehensive testing strategy

### Phase 2: Feature Development and Production Readiness
**Objective**: Execute coordinated development and ensure comprehensive production deployment preparation

1. **Feature Development Execution and Quality Assurance**
   - Coordinate parallel development across teams with synchronized integration points
   - Implement comprehensive testing covering functional, integration, and end-to-end validation
   - Manage issue resolution, requirement clarification, and security compliance validation

2. **Production Deployment and Readiness**
   - Prepare production deployment with proper documentation and configuration
   - Validate user acceptance and business requirements with stakeholder confirmation
   - Implement monitoring, support procedures, and post-deployment feedback integration
