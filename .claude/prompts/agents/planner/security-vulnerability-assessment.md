# Security Vulnerability Assessment Excellence

**Agent: reviewer**
**Purpose: Conduct comprehensive security vulnerability assessments and establish vulnerability management processes**

---

## 1. üéØ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive security vulnerability assessment processes that proactively identify, assess, and prioritize security weaknesses across applications, dependencies, and infrastructure. Create systematic vulnerability management frameworks that ensure timely remediation and continuous security improvement based on the technology stack and security requirements specified in CLAUDE.md.

## 2. üîÑ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Security Assessment Strategy and Comprehensive Scanning
**Objective**: Establish security assessment framework and implement comprehensive multi-layer security scanning

1. **Security Assessment Strategy and Framework Design**
   - Define comprehensive security assessment strategy covering application code, dependencies, and infrastructure
   - Design vulnerability assessment methodology using static analysis, dynamic testing, and dependency scanning
   - Configure security scanning automation with development workflow integration and CI/CD processes

2. **Comprehensive Security Scanning Implementation**
   - Implement static (SAST) and dynamic (DAST) application security testing capabilities
   - Establish dependency and third-party component security scanning with supply chain validation
   - Deploy infrastructure security scanning covering cloud configurations and compliance validation

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Analysis and Remediation Management
**Objective**: Execute systematic vulnerability analysis and establish comprehensive remediation and improvement processes

1. **Vulnerability Analysis and Risk Management**
   - Implement vulnerability severity assessment with CVSS scoring and business impact analysis
   - Design risk-based prioritization considering business context and asset criticality
   - Establish vulnerability tracking and lifecycle management from discovery through remediation validation

2. **Remediation and Continuous Security Improvement**
   - Design vulnerability remediation workflows with clear timelines and ownership
   - Implement security communication, training programs, and stakeholder notification procedures
   - Enable continuous security monitoring and proactive assessment with improvement feedback loops
