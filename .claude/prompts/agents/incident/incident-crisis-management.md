# Incident Crisis Management and Emergency Response Coordination

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive crisis management procedures that enable rapid response, effective coordination, and systematic resolution during critical system outages and emergency situations. Create robust incident command systems adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements, establishing leadership protocols, resource mobilization, stakeholder communication, and business continuity procedures that minimize impact and ensure coordinated response across different technology stacks and business domains.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Crisis Assessment and Initial Response Activation
1. **Read CLAUDE.md incident severity and business impact criteria** - Extract incident classification, response time requirements, and business continuity priorities
2. **Assess incident severity and business impact** - Evaluate system outage scope, user impact, revenue effects, and regulatory implications
3. **Activate appropriate incident response procedures** - Trigger response protocols based on severity, mobilize resources, and establish incident command
4. **Establish incident command structure** - Assign incident commander role, define response team roles, and create communication channels
5. **Initiate stakeholder notification procedures** - Begin internal team alerts, management escalation, and customer communication workflows

### Phase 2: Response Team Mobilization and Communication Setup
1. **Assemble incident response team** - Mobilize appropriate technical experts, subject matter specialists, and support personnel
2. **Establish communication channels and war rooms** - Create dedicated communication channels, screen sharing, and collaborative workspace
3. **Configure incident tracking and documentation** - Initialize incident tickets, timeline tracking, and decision-making documentation
4. **Coordinate with external parties** - Engage vendors, partners, regulatory bodies, and external support resources as needed
5. **Implement business continuity measures** - Activate alternate workflows, backup systems, and emergency procedures

### Phase 3: Investigation Coordination and Resolution Management
1. **Coordinate technical investigation efforts** - Direct parallel investigation streams, hypothesis testing, and evidence gathering
2. **Manage resolution attempts and validation** - Oversee fix implementation, testing procedures, and resolution verification
3. **Maintain incident timeline and decision logging** - Document investigation findings, resolution attempts, and key decision points
4. **Coordinate rollback and recovery procedures** - Manage system rollbacks, service restoration, and performance validation
5. **Monitor resolution effectiveness and system stability** - Verify fix effectiveness, monitor for regression, and ensure system stability

### Phase 4: Crisis Resolution and Recovery Validation
1. **Validate complete system restoration** - Confirm service functionality, performance restoration, and user experience recovery
2. **Conduct stakeholder communication and updates** - Provide resolution updates, service status confirmation, and timeline communication
3. **Implement post-resolution monitoring** - Establish enhanced monitoring, stability verification, and regression detection
4. **Document incident resolution and lessons learned** - Capture resolution details, decision rationale, and immediate improvement opportunities
5. **Transition to post-incident analysis phase** - Hand off documentation, prepare for postmortem, and schedule follow-up activities
