# Incident Post-Mortem Analysis and Organizational Learning Implementation

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive post-incident analysis procedures facilitating blameless learning, systematic improvement, and organizational resilience through thorough root cause analysis and actionable improvement implementation. Create postmortem frameworks adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements with analysis methodologies, improvement tracking, and knowledge sharing preventing incident recurrence across technology stacks.

## 2. ðŸ”„ HIGH-LEVEL ALGORITHMS

### Phase 1: Analysis Preparation and Root Cause Investigation
**Objective**: Prepare comprehensive analysis and conduct systematic root cause investigation

1. **Post-Incident Analysis Preparation and Data Collection**
   - Read CLAUDE.md learning requirements to extract organizational priorities, improvement tracking, and knowledge sharing
   - Collect comprehensive incident documentation, identify postmortem participants, and schedule analysis sessions
   - Organize incident data, prepare analysis framework, and establish psychological safety guidelines

2. **Root Cause Analysis and Contributing Factor Investigation**
   - Facilitate blameless postmortem sessions focused on system improvements rather than individual accountability
   - Conduct systematic root cause analysis, map incident timeline, and identify system vulnerabilities
   - Assess organizational factors, evaluate communication effectiveness, and analyze team coordination impacts

### Phase 2: Improvement Planning and Organizational Learning
**Objective**: Execute improvement identification and establish organizational learning integration

1. **Improvement Identification and Action Planning**
   - Generate actionable improvement recommendations addressing identified issues with measurable outcomes
   - Prioritize improvements by prevention potential, assign ownership with timelines, and design validation metrics
   - Create improvement tracking systems with progress monitoring and completion validation

2. **Knowledge Sharing and Organizational Learning Integration**
   - Document comprehensive postmortem findings and share learnings across organization
   - Update incident response procedures, implement knowledge management, and create pattern recognition
   - Track long-term organizational learning effectiveness and measure incident recurrence reduction
