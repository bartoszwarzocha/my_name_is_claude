# Incident Escalation Procedures and Communication Management

## 1. ðŸŽ¯ FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

Design and implement comprehensive incident escalation procedures that ensure appropriate stakeholder notification, management involvement, and resource mobilization based on incident severity and business impact. Create systematic escalation frameworks adapted to CLAUDE.md requirements, establishing escalation triggers, communication protocols, authority delegation, and decision-making procedures that maintain effective incident response across different organizational structures and business domains.

### Phase 3: Escalation Execution and Coordination Management
1. **Implement escalation decision logic and triggering** - Create automated and manual escalation triggering based on incident characteristics and timeline
2. **Coordinate multi-level stakeholder engagement** - Manage simultaneous communication with different organizational levels and external parties
3. **Facilitate escalation decision-making and resource allocation** - Support management decision-making, resource authorization, and strategic response coordination
4. **Manage escalation communication flow and updates** - Coordinate bidirectional communication between incident response team and escalated stakeholders
5. **Track escalation effectiveness and response coordination** - Monitor escalation response times, decision quality, and stakeholder engagement effectiveness

### Phase 4: Escalation Analysis and Procedure Optimization
1. **Analyze escalation effectiveness and timing** - Evaluate escalation triggers, response times, and stakeholder engagement quality
2. **Assess communication quality and stakeholder satisfaction** - Review message clarity, information completeness, and stakeholder response effectiveness
3. **Optimize escalation procedures based on incident learnings** - Refine escalation triggers, improve communication templates, and enhance notification procedures
4. **Update stakeholder information and preferences** - Maintain current contact information, communication preferences, and organizational changes
5. **Document escalation lessons learned and best practices** - Capture escalation insights, successful practices, and improvement opportunities for future incidents
