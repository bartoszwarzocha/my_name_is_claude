## üéØ Best Practices for Orchestration

### Scenario Selection Guidelines

1. **Project Assessment:**
   - Analyze project requirements and constraints
   - Identify critical success factors (speed, security, data, etc.)
   - Consider compliance and regulatory requirements
   - Evaluate team expertise and resource availability

2. **Parameter Optimization:**
   - Use appropriate parameters for your specific context
   - Consider scalability and future growth requirements
   - Balance speed vs. thoroughness based on project phase
   - Align security level with actual risk requirements

3. **Quality Gate Configuration:**
   - Customize quality gates for your specific requirements
   - Adjust validation strictness based on project criticality
   - Consider automated vs. manual validation points
   - Plan for iterative improvement based on results

### Execution Best Practices

1. **Pre-Orchestration Preparation:**
   - Ensure all required agents have appropriate prompts
   - Verify project requirements are clearly defined
   - Check system requirements and dependencies
   - Review compliance requirements if applicable

2. **During Orchestration:**
   - Monitor progress through generated logs
   - Address quality gate failures promptly
   - Maintain clear communication channels
   - Document decisions and rationale

3. **Post-Orchestration:**
   - Review generated reports thoroughly
   - Implement recommended improvements
   - Document lessons learned for future projects
   - Share insights with team members
