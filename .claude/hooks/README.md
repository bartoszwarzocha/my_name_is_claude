## üöÄ Quick Setup

### 1. Configure in Claude Code Settings

Add to your `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "user-prompt-submit": ".claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit-hook.sh"
  }
}
```

### 2. Git Integration (Optional)

For git integration, create symbolic links:

```bash
# In your git repository
ln -s ../../.claude/hooks/pre-commit-validation.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
ln -s ../../.claude/hooks/post-commit-sync.sh .git/hooks/post-commit
```

### 3. Manual Execution

All hooks can be run manually for testing:

```bash
# Test basic framework hooks
./.claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit-hook.sh
./.claude/hooks/pre-commit-validation.sh
./.claude/hooks/post-commit-sync.sh
./.claude/hooks/task-start-logger.sh "test-agent" "testing"
./.claude/hooks/quality-gate-checker.sh "frontend-engineer"

# Test simplified multi-agent hooks
./.claude/hooks/agent-handoff.sh "test-from" "test-to"
./.claude/hooks/cross-agent-dependency-tracker.sh "check" "frontend-engineer"
./.claude/hooks/agent-conflict-resolution.sh "detect"

# Test advanced hooks
./.claude/hooks/prompt-quality-validator.sh "" "comprehensive"
./.claude/hooks/agent-performance-monitor.sh "analyze"
./.claude/hooks/compliance-automation.sh "all"
```

## üìä Hook Outputs and Logs

### Work Directory Files Created

#### Basic Framework Logs

- `work/documentation-updates.log` - Documentation change tracking
- `work/agent-activity.log` - Multi-agent task coordination log
- `work/current-stats.md` - Current framework statistics
- `work/sync-activity.log` - Prompt synchronization history
- `work/quality-gates.log` - Quality validation results

#### Advanced Multi-Agent Logs

- `work/quality-reports/` - Prompt quality validation reports
- `work/performance/` - Agent performance metrics and reports
- `work/compliance/` - Compliance audit reports (WCAG, GDPR, SOX)

### Log File Formats

**agent-activity.log:**
```text
=====================================
TASK START: 2025-09-15 09:30:00
Agent: frontend-engineer
Description: Angular component development
Session ID: 12345
=====================================
```

**quality-gates.log:**
```text
2025-09-15 09:30:00: Quality gate check for security-engineer (type: threat-modeling) - Exit code: 0
```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Hooks

1. Create new shell script in `.claude/hooks/`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/your-hook.sh`
3. Add appropriate logging to `work/` directory
4. Update this README with documentation

### Hook Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your Custom Hook
# Description of what this hook does
# Triggers: When this hook should run

echo "üîß Your Custom Hook - Starting..."

# Your hook logic here
# Keep it simple and TodoWrite-compatible

# Log the activity (optional)
echo "$(date): Custom hook executed" >> work/custom-hook.log

echo "‚úÖ Your Custom Hook completed"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied:**
```bash
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
```

**Work Directory Missing:**
```bash
mkdir -p work
```

**Hook Not Triggering:**
- Check Claude Code settings configuration
- Verify hook script has executable permissions
- Review Claude Code logs for error messages

### Debug Mode

Run hooks with debug output:
```bash
bash -x ./.claude/hooks/hook-name.sh
```

## üìà Best Practices

1. **TodoWrite Integration:** Use hooks to generate TodoWrite patterns for coordination
2. **Keep Simple:** Simplified hooks focus on essential functionality
3. **Fast Execution:** Hooks complete in < 2 seconds for smooth workflow
4. **Minimal Logging:** Only essential logs to avoid clutter
5. **Testing:** Test hooks manually before automated workflows

## üîÑ Integration with TodoWrite Workflow

### Recommended Hook Usage for TodoWrite Coordination

**Starting New Work:**
1. Use `task-start-logger.sh` to log agent activation
2. Use `agent-handoff.sh` for TodoWrite patterns when receiving work
3. Use `cross-agent-dependency-tracker.sh` to check prerequisites

**During Development:**
1. Use `quality-gate-checker.sh` for validation checkpoints
2. Use `agent-conflict-resolution.sh` if coordination issues arise
3. Use `prompt-quality-validator.sh` for maintaining standards

**Completing Work:**
1. Use `post-commit-sync.sh` to update framework statistics
2. Use `compliance-automation.sh` for final validation
3. Use `agent-handoff.sh` when passing work to next agent

### TodoWrite Pattern Examples

All simplified hooks generate TodoWrite-compatible patterns:

```javascript
// Generated by agent-handoff.sh
TodoWrite({
  content: "Process handoff from business-analyst",
  status: "in_progress",
  activeForm: "Processing business-analyst handoff"
});

// Manual coordination based on dependency-tracker.sh
TodoWrite({
  content: "Coordinate with security-engineer for requirements",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Waiting for security requirements"
});

// Conflict resolution guidance
TodoWrite({
  content: "Resolve workflow conflict detected by hooks",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Resolving agent coordination conflict"
});
```

**Note:** These simplified hooks are optimized for TodoWrite workflow integration while maintaining essential multi-agent coordination capabilities. Complex orchestration features have been removed in favor of TodoWrite-driven coordination.
