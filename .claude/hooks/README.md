## üîß Customization

### Adding New Hooks

1. Create new shell script in `.claude/hooks/`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x .claude/hooks/your-hook.sh`
3. Add appropriate logging to `work/` directory
4. Update this README with documentation

### Hook Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your Custom Hook
# Description of what this hook does
# Triggers: When this hook should run

echo "üîß Your Custom Hook - Starting..."

# Your hook logic here
# ...

# Log the activity
echo "$(date): Custom hook executed" >> work/custom-hook.log

echo "‚úÖ Your Custom Hook completed"
```

### Environment Variables

Hooks can use these environment variables:

- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT` - Project root directory
- `CLAUDE_AGENT_TYPE` - Current agent type (if available)
- `CLAUDE_TASK_ID` - Unique task identifier (if available)

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Permission Denied:**
```bash
chmod +x .claude/hooks/*.sh
```

**Work Directory Missing:**
```bash
mkdir -p work
```

**Hook Not Triggering:**
- Check Claude Code settings configuration
- Verify hook script has executable permissions
- Review Claude Code logs for error messages

### Debug Mode

Run hooks with debug output:
```bash
bash -x ./.claude/hooks/hook-name.sh
```

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring:** Check `work/` logs regularly for coordination issues
2. **Hook Performance:** Keep hooks fast (< 5 seconds) to avoid workflow interruption
3. **Error Handling:** All hooks include proper exit codes for CI/CD integration
4. **Documentation:** Update this README when adding custom hooks
5. **Testing:** Test hooks manually before adding to automated workflows

## üîÑ Integration with Multi-Agent Workflow

### Phase-Based Hook Usage

**Phase 1 (Discovery):**

- Use `task-start-logger.sh` for business-analyst and product-manager coordination
- Run `quality-gate-checker.sh` for requirements validation
- Deploy `cross-agent-dependency-tracker.sh` to establish workflow dependencies
- Use `agent-conflict-resolution.sh` to detect early requirement conflicts

**Phase 2 (Architecture):**

- Deploy `quality-gate-checker.sh` for security-engineer validation
- Use `agent-handoff.sh` for business-analyst ‚Üí software-architect transitions
- Run `compliance-automation.sh` for early security and accessibility planning
- Monitor with `agent-performance-monitor.sh` for architecture definition tasks

**Phase 3 (Development):**

- Heavy usage of `task-start-logger.sh` for parallel development coordination
- Continuous `quality-gate-checker.sh` for frontend and security validation
- Active `cross-agent-dependency-tracker.sh` validation for integration readiness
- Use `prompt-quality-validator.sh` for maintaining development standard quality
- Deploy `agent-conflict-resolution.sh` for resource contention management

**Phase 4 (Deployment):**

- Pre-deployment validation with all quality gates
- Comprehensive `compliance-automation.sh` validation (WCAG, GDPR, SOX)
- `agent-performance-monitor.sh` for deployment task optimization
- Post-deployment synchronization with `post-commit-sync.sh`

**Note:** These hooks are designed to work seamlessly with the 11-agent Claude Code framework while maintaining flexibility for custom workflows and project-specific requirements.
