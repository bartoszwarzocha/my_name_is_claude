# Hierarchical TODO Management System

**Purpose: Multi-level task management with agent ownership and workflow integration**

---

## ðŸŽ¯ System Overview

### Hierarchy Levels

```yaml
hierarchy_structure:
  epic:
    scope: "Business initiative or major feature set"
    duration: "weeks to months"
    owner_agents: ["business-analyst", "product-manager"]
    example: "Complete user authentication system overhaul"

  feature:
    scope: "Architectural component or user-facing capability"
    duration: "weeks"
    owner_agents: ["software-architect", "ux-designer", "security-engineer", "data-engineer"]
    example: "OAuth2 implementation with multi-factor authentication"

  task:
    scope: "Implementation work item"
    duration: "days"
    owner_agents: ["frontend-engineer", "api-engineer", "data-engineer", "security-engineer", "qa-engineer"]
    example: "Implement JWT token refresh mechanism"

  subtask:
    scope: "Granular implementation detail"
    duration: "hours"
    owner_agents: ["Any technical agent"]
    example: "Add unit tests for token validation utility"
```

## ðŸ“‹ TODO Data Structure

### Epic Level TODO

Epic-level todos use the standard TodoWrite API with enhanced content descriptions:

```typescript
// Epic Creation Example
TodoWrite({
  content: "Epic: [Business Initiative] - [Brief Description]",
  status: "in_progress",
  activeForm: "Analyzing business requirements for [initiative]"
});

// Epic components are managed through content descriptions:
// - Business value and success criteria in content
// - Agent coordination through handoff todos
// - Progress tracking through status updates
// - Timeline management through activeForm descriptions
```

### Feature Level TODO

Feature-level todos use the standard TodoWrite API with technical context in content:

```typescript
// Feature Creation Example
TodoWrite({
  content: "Feature: [User-Facing Capability] - [Technical Requirements]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Defining [capability] with acceptance criteria"
});

// Feature coordination examples:
TodoWrite({
  content: "Validate Feature technical feasibility with software-architect",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Coordinating technical validation for [feature]"
});

// Quality gates managed through separate todos:
TodoWrite({
  content: "Feature design approval from ux-designer",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Awaiting design approval for [feature]"
});
```

### Task Level TODO

Task-level todos use the standard TodoWrite API with implementation details in content:

```typescript
// Task Creation Example
TodoWrite({
  content: "Task: [Implementation Work] - assigned to [agent]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Creating [implementation] task for [agent]"
});

// Task with dependencies:
TodoWrite({
  content: "Task: [Implementation] - depends on [other task] completion",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Waiting for [dependency] before starting [implementation]"
});

// Quality tracking through separate todos:
TodoWrite({
  content: "Code review for Task: [implementation]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Reviewing [implementation] code for quality"
});

TodoWrite({
  content: "Write tests for Task: [implementation]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Writing comprehensive tests for [implementation]"
});
```

### Subtask Level TODO

Subtask-level todos use the standard TodoWrite API with granular implementation details:

```typescript
// Subtask Creation Example
TodoWrite({
  content: "Implement [specific functionality] for [component]",
  status: "in_progress",
  activeForm: "Implementing [functionality] in [component]"
});

// Subtask with file context:
TodoWrite({
  content: "Add [functionality] to [filename] - [specific implementation]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Adding [functionality] to [component] file"
});

// Subtask completion:
TodoWrite({
  content: "Implement [specific functionality] for [component]",
  status: "completed",
  activeForm: "Completed [functionality] implementation"
});
```

## ðŸ”„ Workflow Integration

### Epic Creation Workflow

```yaml
epic_creation:
  trigger: "New business initiative identified"
  
  step_1:
    agent: business-analyst
    prompt: stakeholder-requirements-gathering.md
    output: business_requirements_document
    
  step_2:
    agent: product-manager  
    prompt: mvp-scoping-and-roadmap-planning.md
    input: business_requirements_document
    output: epic_definition
    
  step_3:
    agent: reviewer
    prompt: epic-validation-and-approval.md
    input: epic_definition
    output: validated_epic_todo
    
  auto_generated_todos:
    epic: 1
    estimated_features: 3-8
    estimated_tasks: 15-40
    estimated_subtasks: 50-200
```

### Feature Breakdown Workflow

```yaml
feature_breakdown:
  trigger: "Epic approved and ready for technical planning"
  
  parallel_analysis:
    architecture_agent:
      prompt: feature-architecture-planning.md
      output: technical_requirements
      
    ux_agent:
      prompt: feature-ux-planning.md  
      output: user_experience_requirements
      
    security_agent:
      prompt: feature-security-planning.md
      output: security_requirements
      
  consolidation:
    agent: software-architect
    prompt: feature-consolidation-and-tasking.md
    inputs: [technical_requirements, user_experience_requirements, security_requirements]
    output: feature_todos_with_tasks
```

### Task Assignment Guidelines

Task assignment is handled through TodoWrite content descriptions:

```yaml
# Task Assignment Patterns
Frontend_Tasks:
  - "Task: UI component implementation - assigned to frontend-engineer"
  - "Task: Responsive design for [feature] - assigned to frontend-engineer"
  - "Task: Accessibility compliance - assigned to frontend-engineer"

Backend_Tasks:
  - "Task: API endpoint development - assigned to api-engineer"
  - "Task: Microservice implementation - assigned to api-engineer"
  - "Task: Authentication system - assigned to api-engineer"

Data_Tasks:
  - "Task: Database schema design - assigned to data-engineer"
  - "Task: Data migration - assigned to data-engineer"
  - "Task: ETL pipeline - assigned to data-engineer"

Security_Tasks:
  - "Task: Security controls implementation - assigned to security-engineer"
  - "Task: Vulnerability assessment - assigned to security-engineer"
  - "Task: Compliance validation - assigned to security-engineer"

Quality_Tasks:
  - "Task: Test automation - assigned to qa-engineer"
  - "Task: Performance testing - assigned to qa-engineer"
  - "Task: Quality validation - assigned to qa-engineer"

Infrastructure_Tasks:
  - "Task: Deployment pipeline - assigned to deployment-engineer"
  - "Task: Infrastructure setup - assigned to deployment-engineer"
  - "Task: Monitoring configuration - assigned to deployment-engineer"
```

Workload balancing through TodoWrite coordination:

```typescript
// Check current workload
TodoWrite({
  content: "Check current agent workload before task assignment",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Checking agent capacity for task assignment"
});

// Reassign if overloaded
TodoWrite({
  content: "Reassign Task: [task] from [overloaded-agent] to [available-agent]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Reassigning task due to workload balancing"
});
```

## ðŸ“Š Progress Tracking and Metrics

Progress tracking is managed through TodoWrite status updates and summary todos:

### Progress Reporting TodoWrite Patterns

```typescript
// Daily progress updates
TodoWrite({
  content: "Daily progress: Epic [name] - Features: [completed]/[total], Tasks: [completed]/[total]",
  status: "completed",
  activeForm: "Reporting daily progress for Epic [name]"
});

// Weekly velocity tracking
TodoWrite({
  content: "Weekly velocity: [tasks] completed, [time] spent, [blockers] resolved",
  status: "completed",
  activeForm: "Reporting weekly team velocity and progress"
});

// Milestone progress
TodoWrite({
  content: "Milestone reached: [milestone name] - [description of achievement]",
  status: "completed",
  activeForm: "Achieved milestone: [milestone name]"
});

// Progress blocking issues
TodoWrite({
  content: "Progress blocked: [issue description] - requires [resolution]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Resolving blocking issue: [issue]"
});
```

### Burndown Tracking

Simple burndown tracking through TodoWrite daily updates:

```typescript
// Daily burndown update
TodoWrite({
  content: "Burndown: [remaining tasks] tasks, [remaining effort] effort, [completion %]% complete",
  status: "completed",
  activeForm: "Tracking daily burndown progress"
});

// Burndown trend analysis
TodoWrite({
  content: "Burndown analysis: [trend description] - [on track/behind/ahead] schedule",
  status: "completed",
  activeForm: "Analyzing burndown trend and schedule adherence"
});

// Burndown alerts
TodoWrite({
  content: "Burndown alert: [issue] detected - [recommended action]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Addressing burndown schedule concern"
});
```

## ðŸš¨ Smart Notifications and Alerts

Notifications and alerts managed through TodoWrite status tracking:

### Alert TodoWrite Patterns

```typescript
// Task overdue alert
TodoWrite({
  content: "Alert: Task [task] is overdue - requires immediate attention",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Addressing overdue task: [task]"
});

// Epic at risk alert
TodoWrite({
  content: "Alert: Epic [epic] at risk of missing deadline - review required",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Reviewing Epic timeline and risks"
});

// Quality gate alert
TodoWrite({
  content: "Alert: Task [task] waiting for code review - escalation needed",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Escalating code review request"
});

// Dependency blocking alert
TodoWrite({
  content: "Alert: Task [task] blocked by dependencies - coordination required",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Resolving task dependency blockers"
});
```

### Task Recommendations

Task recommendations through TodoWrite coordination:

```typescript
// Recommend next tasks for agent
TodoWrite({
  content: "Recommendation: Next tasks for [agent] - [task1], [task2], [task3]",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Reviewing recommended tasks for [agent]"
});

// Task prioritization
TodoWrite({
  content: "Priority analysis: [high priority tasks] should be completed first",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Prioritizing tasks based on urgency and dependencies"
});

// Capacity planning
TodoWrite({
  content: "Capacity check: [agent] current workload vs available tasks",
  status: "pending",
  activeForm: "Checking agent capacity for task assignment"
});
```

## ðŸ“¤ Integration Points

### Claude Code TodoWrite Integration

```typescript
class ClaudeCodeTodoIntegration {
  syncToClaudeCode(todos: HierarchicalTodo[]): void {
    const claudeCodeTodos = todos.map(todo => ({
      content: this.formatTodoContent(todo),
      status: this.mapStatus(todo.status),
      activeForm: this.generateActiveForm(todo)
    }));
    
    // Use existing TodoWrite tool
    this.claudeCodeAPI.updateTodos(claudeCodeTodos);
  }
  
  private formatTodoContent(todo: HierarchicalTodo): string {
    switch (todo.type) {
      case 'epic':
        return `${todo.title} (${todo.features.length} features, ~${this.calculateTotalHours(todo)}h)`;
      case 'feature':
        return `${todo.title} (${todo.tasks.length} tasks, ~${this.calculateFeatureHours(todo)}h)`;
      case 'task':
        return `${todo.title} (${todo.estimated_hours}h, ${todo.primary_agent})`;
      case 'subtask':
        return `${todo.title} (${todo.estimated_minutes}min)`;
    }
  }
}
```
