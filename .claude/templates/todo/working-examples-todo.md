## üöÄ Copy-Paste Quick Start

### For New Projects - Immediate Usage

1. **Configure CLAUDE.md Section 8:**
```yaml
todo_management_enabled: true
todo_hierarchy_level: hierarchical
auto_task_creation: true
epic_management: true
feature_breakdown: true
agent_coordination: true
session_todos: true
```

2. **Start with Epic (business-analyst):**
```typescript
TodoWrite({
  content: "Epic: [Your business initiative]",
  status: "in_progress",
  activeForm: "Analyzing business requirements for [initiative] Epic"
});
```

3. **Follow the patterns above** for your specific project context

4. **Use agent coordination hooks** for automated handoffs

**These examples provide concrete, production-ready TodoWrite commands that agents can use immediately to create working hierarchical TODO systems.**
