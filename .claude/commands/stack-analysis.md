Perform comprehensive technology stack analysis:

1. Read CLAUDE.md to understand current stack configuration
2. Scan codebase for technology indicators and patterns
3. Analyze dependencies, frameworks, and tools
4. Assess architectural decisions and technology choices
5. Evaluate stack maturity, support, and future viability
6. Generate comprehensive stack report with:
   - Complete technology inventory and versions
   - Architecture patterns and design decisions
   - Technology compatibility matrix
   - Upgrade and migration recommendations
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Best practices compliance evaluation

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Argument Handling Logic:**
- If arguments contain "--deep": Perform in-depth analysis including performance metrics, security assessment, and detailed compatibility review
- If arguments contain "--recommendations": Include strategic technology recommendations and migration suggestions
- If no arguments or empty: Perform standard technology stack analysis with key findings and insights

Output: Detailed stack analysis with visual technology mapping and strategic recommendations.
