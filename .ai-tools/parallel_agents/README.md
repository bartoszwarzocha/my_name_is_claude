## üöÄ Quick Start

### Basic Concurrent Execution

```python
from parallel_agents import ParallelExecutor, AgentTask, ExecutionStrategy

# Initialize executor
executor = ParallelExecutor()

# Create tasks
tasks = [
    AgentTask(
        agent_type="software-architect",
        task_id="task_1",
        description="Design system architecture",
        priority="high"
    ),
    AgentTask(
        agent_type="backend-engineer",
        task_id="task_2",
        description="Implement API endpoints",
        priority="high",
        dependencies=["task_1"]  # Waits for architect
    ),
    AgentTask(
        agent_type="frontend-engineer",
        task_id="task_3",
        description="Build user interface",
        priority="high",
        dependencies=["task_1"]  # Waits for architect
    )
]

# Execute in parallel
result = executor.execute_parallel(
    tasks,
    strategy=ExecutionStrategy.CONCURRENT
)

# Check results
print(f"Completed: {result.completed_tasks}/{result.total_tasks}")
print(f"Duration: {result.total_duration_seconds:.2f}s")
```

### Pipeline Execution

```python
# Execute in pipeline stages
result = executor.execute_parallel(
    tasks,
    strategy=ExecutionStrategy.PIPELINE
)

# Pipeline automatically:
# 1. Design stage (architect + ux-designer in parallel)
# 2. Implementation stage (backend + frontend in parallel)
# 3. Testing stage (qa-engineer)
# 4. Review stage (reviewer)
# 5. Deploy stage (deployment-engineer)
```

## üìã Execution Strategies

### 1. Concurrent Strategy

**Best for:** Independent tasks that can run simultaneously

**Features:**
- Maximum parallelization (up to 5 agents)
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Best performance for independent work

**Example:**
```python
# Architecture team works in parallel
tasks = [
    AgentTask("software-architect", "task_1", "Design backend architecture"),
    AgentTask("ux-designer", "task_2", "Design user experience"),
    AgentTask("data-engineer", "task_3", "Design data pipeline")
]

result = executor.execute_parallel(tasks, ExecutionStrategy.CONCURRENT)
# All 3 agents run simultaneously
```

### 2. Pipeline Strategy

**Best for:** Sequential workflow with clear stages

**Features:**
- Stage-based execution
- Checkpoints between stages
- Fail-fast support
- Parallel execution within stages

**Configuration:**
```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "defaultPipeline": [
      {"stage": "design", "agents": ["software-architect", "ux-designer"], "parallel": true},
      {"stage": "implement", "agents": ["backend-engineer", "frontend-engineer"], "parallel": true},
      {"stage": "test", "agents": ["qa-engineer"], "parallel": false},
      {"stage": "deploy", "agents": ["deployment-engineer"], "parallel": false}
    ],
    "checkpointBetweenStages": true,
    "failFast": true
  }
}
```

### 3. Hybrid Strategy

**Best for:** Complex workflows with mixed requirements

**Features:**
- Combines concurrent and pipeline approaches
- Rule-based strategy selection
- Maximum flexibility

**Example:**
```json
{
  "hybrid": {
    "rules": [
      {
        "condition": "architecture_phase",
        "strategy": "concurrent",
        "agents": ["software-architect", "ux-designer"]
      },
      {
        "condition": "quality_phase",
        "strategy": "pipeline",
        "agents": ["qa-engineer", "security-engineer"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## üîó Dependency Management

### Automatic Dependency Resolution

The system automatically orders tasks based on dependencies:

```python
from parallel_agents import DependencyManager

# Create dependency manager
manager = DependencyManager({
    "backend-engineer": {
        "dependsOn": ["software-architect"],
        "provides": ["api", "database"]
    },
    "frontend-engineer": {
        "dependsOn": ["ux-designer", "backend-engineer"],
        "provides": ["ui"]
    },
    "qa-engineer": {
        "dependsOn": ["backend-engineer", "frontend-engineer"],
        "provides": ["test_results"]
    }
})

# Resolve execution order
agents = ["backend-engineer", "frontend-engineer", "qa-engineer", "software-architect", "ux-designer"]
ordered, errors = manager.resolve_execution_order(agents)
# Result: ["software-architect", "ux-designer", "backend-engineer", "frontend-engineer", "qa-engineer"]

# Get parallel groups
groups = manager.get_parallel_groups(agents)
# Result: [
#   ["software-architect", "ux-designer"],    # Group 1: Can run together
#   ["backend-engineer"],                      # Group 2: Waits for Group 1
#   ["frontend-engineer"],                     # Group 3: Waits for Group 2
#   ["qa-engineer"]                            # Group 4: Waits for Group 3
# ]
```

### Circular Dependency Detection

```python
# Detect cycles
cycle = manager.detect_circular_dependencies(agents)
if cycle:
    print(f"Circular dependency detected: {cycle}")
```

## üìä Task Management

### Priority-Based Task Queue

```python
from parallel_agents import TaskQueue

# Create queue
queue = TaskQueue(max_size=100)

# Enqueue tasks with priorities
queue.enqueue("task_1", "software-architect", priority="critical")
queue.enqueue("task_2", "backend-engineer", priority="high")
queue.enqueue("task_3", "frontend-engineer", priority="medium")
queue.enqueue("task_4", "qa-engineer", priority="low")

# Dequeue returns highest priority task with satisfied dependencies
task = queue.dequeue()
```

### Task Status Tracking

```python
# Create task
task = AgentTask(
    agent_type="backend-engineer",
    task_id="task_123",
    description="Implement authentication API",
    priority="high",
    tags=["security", "authentication"]
)

# Task progresses through states:
# PENDING ‚Üí QUEUED ‚Üí RUNNING ‚Üí COMPLETED (or FAILED)

# Get task status
status = executor.get_task_status("task_123")
print(f"Status: {status.status}")
print(f"Duration: {status.duration_seconds}s")
```

## üîÑ Checkpoint Integration

The system automatically integrates with the Advanced Checkpoint System (v3.7.0):

### Automatic Checkpoints

```python
# Checkpoints are created automatically:
# 1. Before parallel execution starts
# 2. Before each agent execution (via MultiAgentCoordinator)
# 3. After each agent execution
# 4. Between pipeline stages
# 5. After parallel execution completes

result = executor.execute_parallel(tasks, auto_checkpoint=True)

# Access checkpoint IDs
for task in result.task_results:
    print(f"Task {task.agent_type} checkpoint: {task.checkpoint_id}")
```

### Rollback on Failure

```python
# If execution fails, automatically rollback to pre-execution checkpoint
# (if enabled in configuration)

{
  "checkpointIntegration": {
    "enabled": true,
    "rollbackOnFailure": true,
    "preserveSuccessfulAgents": true
  }
}
```

## üí∞ Cost Optimization Integration

Integrates with Intelligent Model Configuration System (v3.6.0):

```python
# Each agent automatically gets appropriate model:
# - software-architect ‚Üí Claude Opus (complex reasoning)
# - backend-engineer ‚Üí Claude Sonnet (balanced)
# - qa-engineer ‚Üí Claude Haiku (simple tasks)

# Budget-aware execution
{
  "costOptimization": {
    "enabled": true,
    "budgetAware": true,
    "pauseOnBudgetExceeded": true,
    "priorityBasedExecution": true
  }
}

# System automatically:
# - Tracks costs per agent
# - Pauses execution if budget exceeded
# - Prioritizes critical tasks when near budget limits
```

## üìà Monitoring & Progress

### Real-Time Progress Tracking

```python
# Monitor execution in real-time
{
  "monitoring": {
    "realTimeProgress": true,
    "progressUpdateInterval": 1,  # seconds
    "performanceMetrics": true
  }
}

# Notifications
# ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Agent started: backend-engineer
# ‚úÖ Agent completed: backend-engineer (12.5s)
# ‚ùå Agent failed: qa-engineer - Test failed
# üéâ Parallel execution completed: 3/4 successful
```

### Performance Metrics

```python
# Get execution result with metrics
result = executor.execute_parallel(tasks)

print(f"Total tasks: {result.total_tasks}")
print(f"Completed: {result.completed_tasks}")
print(f"Failed: {result.failed_tasks}")
print(f"Duration: {result.total_duration_seconds:.2f}s")
print(f"Average CPU: {result.average_cpu_usage:.1f}%")
print(f"Peak Memory: {result.peak_memory_mb:.1f}MB")
print(f"API Calls: {result.total_api_calls}")
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

    },
    "api": {
      "maxConcurrentRequests": 10,
      "perAgentLimit": 3
    }
  }
}
```

### Failure Handling

```python
# Automatic retry on failure
{
  "retryPolicy": {
    "enabled": true,
    "maxRetries": 3,
    "retryDelay": 5,
    "exponentialBackoff": true
  }
}

# Emergency stop
executor.shutdown(wait=True)
```

### Conflict Detection

```python
# Integration with MultiAgentCoordinator
# Detects file conflicts between parallel agents
# Pauses execution on conflicts (if configured)

{
  "conflictResolution": {
    "enabled": true,
    "strategy": "interactive",
    "pauseOnConflict": true
  }
}

## üéØ Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Full Stack Feature Development

```python
# Develop complete feature in parallel
tasks = [
    AgentTask("software-architect", "arch", "Design feature architecture"),
    AgentTask("ux-designer", "ux", "Design user interface", dependencies=["arch"]),
    AgentTask("backend-engineer", "backend", "Implement API", dependencies=["arch"]),
    AgentTask("frontend-engineer", "frontend", "Build UI", dependencies=["ux", "backend"]),
    AgentTask("qa-engineer", "qa", "Test feature", dependencies=["frontend"]),
    AgentTask("security-engineer", "security", "Security audit", dependencies=["frontend"]),
    AgentTask("deployment-engineer", "deploy", "Deploy", dependencies=["qa", "security"])
]

result = executor.execute_parallel(tasks, ExecutionStrategy.PIPELINE)
# Architecture design completes first
# Then UX design and backend implementation run in parallel
# Then frontend builds on both
# Then QA and security run in parallel
# Finally deployment
```

### Use Case 2: Microservices Development

```python
# Develop multiple services simultaneously
tasks = [
    AgentTask("backend-engineer", "auth", "Auth service"),
    AgentTask("backend-engineer", "user", "User service"),
    AgentTask("backend-engineer", "payment", "Payment service"),
    AgentTask("api-engineer", "gateway", "API gateway", dependencies=["auth", "user", "payment"])
]

result = executor.execute_parallel(tasks, ExecutionStrategy.CONCURRENT)
# All 3 services develop in parallel
# Gateway waits for all services to complete
```

### Use Case 3: Codebase Refactoring

```python
# Refactor different modules in parallel
tasks = [
    AgentTask("backend-engineer", "auth_refactor", "Refactor authentication"),
    AgentTask("backend-engineer", "db_refactor", "Refactor database layer"),
    AgentTask("frontend-engineer", "ui_refactor", "Refactor UI components"),
    AgentTask("qa-engineer", "regression", "Regression testing", dependencies=["auth_refactor", "db_refactor", "ui_refactor"])
]

result = executor.execute_parallel(tasks, ExecutionStrategy.CONCURRENT)
# All refactorings happen simultaneously
# Regression tests run after all complete
```

## üìù Best Practices

1. **Define Clear Dependencies** - Specify all agent dependencies explicitly
2. **Use Appropriate Strategy** - Concurrent for independent work, pipeline for sequential
3. **Monitor Resource Usage** - Keep eye on CPU, memory, API limits
4. **Enable Checkpoints** - Always enable automatic checkpointing
5. **Set Priorities** - Use priority levels for critical tasks
6. **Handle Failures** - Configure retry policies and rollback
7. **Test Dependency Graph** - Verify no circular dependencies
8. **Budget Awareness** - Monitor costs during parallel execution
