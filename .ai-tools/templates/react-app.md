## Project Overview
Modern React application with TypeScript, optimized for scalability and performance. Features component-based architecture, state management, and comprehensive testing strategy.

**Core Capabilities**: React 18+ with hooks, TypeScript integration, modern CSS-in-JS styling, responsive design, performance optimization, comprehensive testing, deployment automation.

**Goals**: Fast development cycles, maintainable codebase, excellent user experience, production-ready deployment, team collaboration efficiency.

## Technologies
**Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript ES6+, CSS-in-JS (Styled Components/Emotion), React Router, React Query/SWR
**Backend**: REST/GraphQL API integration, Node.js (optional backend)
**Database**: Browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage), optional backend database
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress (E2E), MSW (API mocking), Storybook
**Deployment**: Vite/Create React App, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Vercel/Netlify/AWS

## Agents and Roles
**Strategy**: product-manager, business-analyst
**Architecture**: software-architect, ux-designer
**Development**: frontend-engineer, api-engineer
**Quality**: qa-engineer, security-engineer
**Operations**: deployment-engineer

## Integrations
**APIs**: REST/GraphQL endpoints, third-party services integration
**Development**: Git workflow, npm/yarn package managers, CI/CD pipelines
**Monitoring**: Error tracking (Sentry), analytics (Google Analytics), performance monitoring

## Requirements
**Performance**: <3s initial load, <1s navigation, optimized bundle size, code splitting
**Security**: HTTPS, secure authentication, XSS/CSRF protection, secure API communication
**Scalability**: Component reusability, modular architecture, lazy loading, responsive design

## Framework Guidelines
**Constraints**: React best practices, TypeScript strict mode, component reusability, performance optimization
**Style**: Functional components with hooks, clear component hierarchy, consistent naming conventions
**Testing**: Unit tests for components, integration tests for user flows, E2E tests for critical paths

## TODO Management
**Core**: Feature-based task organization with TodoWrite integration
**Levels**: Epic (product-manager) → Feature (frontend-engineer) → Component (detailed implementation) → Testing (qa-engineer)
**Templates**:
- **Startup**: Simple hierarchy, session tracking
- **SME**: Full hierarchy, milestone tracking
- **Enterprise**: Complete system + external integration

## Project Ownership
**Team**: Frontend development team with React specialization
**Interface**: Modern React development workflow with TypeScript and testing integration
**Governance**: Code review process, performance monitoring, user experience optimization

## Command-Agent Mapping
**Core Commands**: Session (save/restore/start), Project (health check/new/release), Business (analysis/requirements), Product (planning/MVP), Development (frontend/backend/API), Quality (tests/security), Architecture (design/deployment)
**Rules**: Polish/English support, context awareness, CLAUDE.md adaptation, TodoWrite integration
