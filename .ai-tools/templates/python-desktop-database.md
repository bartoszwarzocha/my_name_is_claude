## Project Overview
Professional desktop application built with Python, wxPython GUI framework, and SQLite database integration. Features modern desktop UI design, robust data management, and cross-platform deployment capabilities.

**Core Capabilities**: wxPython native GUI, SQLite database operations, data visualization, reporting system, user management, backup/restore functionality, cross-platform compatibility, professional packaging.

**Goals**: Native desktop user experience, reliable data persistence, efficient database operations, maintainable codebase, professional application packaging, cross-platform deployment.

## Technologies
**Frontend**: wxPython, wxPython widgets, custom controls, event handling, UI layouts
**Backend**: Python 3.9+, SQLite3, SQLAlchemy ORM, data validation, business logic
**Database**: SQLite database, database migrations, backup systems, data integrity
**Testing**: pytest, unittest, wxPython testing utilities, database testing, UI automation
**Deployment**: PyInstaller, cx_Freeze, cross-platform packaging, installer creation

## Agents and Roles
**Strategy**: product-manager, business-analyst
**Architecture**: software-architect, ux-designer
**Development**: desktop-specialist, data-engineer, backend-engineer
**Quality**: qa-engineer, security-engineer
**Operations**: deployment-engineer

## Integrations
**APIs**: Database APIs, file system integration, external data sources, reporting APIs
**Development**: Git workflow, virtual environments, package management, CI/CD pipelines
**Monitoring**: Application logging, error tracking, usage analytics, performance monitoring

## Requirements
**Performance**: Fast UI responsiveness, efficient database queries, optimized memory usage
**Security**: Data encryption, user authentication, secure data storage, backup protection
**Scalability**: Large dataset handling, concurrent user support, database optimization

## Framework Guidelines
**Constraints**: wxPython best practices, SQLite limitations, cross-platform compatibility, Python packaging
**Style**: MVC architecture, clean separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, user-friendly interface
**Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, database tests, cross-platform testing

## TODO Management
**Core**: Feature-based task organization with TodoWrite integration
**Levels**: Epic (product-manager) → Feature (desktop-specialist) → Component (UI/Database) → Testing (qa-engineer)
**Templates**:
- **Startup**: Simple hierarchy, session tracking
- **SME**: Full hierarchy, milestone tracking
- **Enterprise**: Complete system + external integration

## Project Ownership
**Team**: Desktop application development team with Python and database expertise
**Interface**: Modern Python desktop development with professional database integration
**Governance**: Code review, UI/UX validation, database optimization, deployment automation

## Command-Agent Mapping
**Core Commands**: Session (save/restore/start), Project (health check/new/release), Business (analysis/requirements), Product (planning/MVP), Development (frontend/backend/API), Quality (tests/security), Architecture (design/deployment)
**Rules**: Polish/English support, context awareness, CLAUDE.md adaptation, TodoWrite integration
