## Project Overview
Professional native desktop application built with wxWidgets C++ framework. Features cross-platform compatibility, native performance, modern C++ practices, and comprehensive GUI capabilities for demanding desktop applications.

**Core Capabilities**: Native wxWidgets GUI, cross-platform compatibility, high-performance C++ backend, custom controls, event handling, file operations, printing support, comprehensive testing, professional packaging.

**Goals**: Native desktop performance, cross-platform deployment, maintainable C++ codebase, professional user interface, reliable application behavior, efficient resource usage.

## Technologies
**Frontend**: wxWidgets 3.2+, custom controls, advanced layouts, graphics rendering
**Backend**: C++17/20, STL, Boost libraries, threading, file I/O, networking
**Database**: SQLite C++ integration, database connectivity, ORM libraries
**Testing**: Google Test, wxWidgets testing utilities, unit testing, integration testing
**Deployment**: CMake, cross-platform building, installers (MSI, DEB, DMG), packaging

## Agents and Roles
**Strategy**: product-manager, business-analyst
**Architecture**: software-architect, ux-designer
**Development**: desktop-specialist, graphics-2d-engineer, backend-engineer
**Quality**: qa-engineer, security-engineer
**Operations**: deployment-engineer

## Integrations
**APIs**: System APIs, file system integration, network protocols, external libraries
**Development**: Git workflow, CMake build system, cross-platform CI/CD, package management
**Monitoring**: Application logging, crash reporting, performance profiling, usage analytics

## Requirements
**Performance**: Native performance, efficient memory usage, responsive UI, fast startup
**Security**: Secure file handling, input validation, memory safety, secure communication
**Scalability**: Large dataset handling, multi-threading support, plugin architecture

## Framework Guidelines
**Constraints**: C++ best practices, wxWidgets patterns, cross-platform compatibility, memory management
**Style**: Modern C++ design, RAII principles, clear class hierarchies, comprehensive error handling
**Testing**: Unit tests, GUI tests, cross-platform testing, memory leak detection

## TODO Management
**Core**: Feature-based task organization with TodoWrite integration
**Levels**: Epic (product-manager) → Feature (desktop-specialist) → Component (UI/Logic) → Testing (qa-engineer)
**Templates**:
- **Startup**: Simple hierarchy, session tracking
- **SME**: Full hierarchy, milestone tracking
- **Enterprise**: Complete system + external integration

## Project Ownership
**Team**: C++ desktop development team with wxWidgets and cross-platform expertise
**Interface**: Modern C++ development with professional desktop application standards
**Governance**: Code review, cross-platform testing, performance optimization, security validation

## Command-Agent Mapping
**Core Commands**: Session (save/restore/start), Project (health check/new/release), Business (analysis/requirements), Product (planning/MVP), Development (frontend/backend/API), Quality (tests/security), Architecture (design/deployment)
**Rules**: Polish/English support, context awareness, CLAUDE.md adaptation, TodoWrite integration
