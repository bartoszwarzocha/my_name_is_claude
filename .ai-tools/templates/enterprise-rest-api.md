## Project Overview
Enterprise-grade REST API built with modern frameworks, featuring comprehensive security, scalability, monitoring, and compliance. Optimized for high-performance, mission-critical business applications with enterprise integration requirements.

**Core Capabilities**: RESTful API design, enterprise security (OAuth2, JWT), database integration, caching, monitoring, logging, documentation, testing, deployment automation, compliance frameworks.

**Goals**: Enterprise-scale performance, comprehensive security, regulatory compliance, high availability, maintainable architecture, seamless integration, operational excellence.

## Technologies
**Frontend**: API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger), admin dashboards, monitoring interfaces
**Backend**: Java Spring Boot/C# .NET Core/Java Jakarta EE, enterprise frameworks, microservices
**Database**: PostgreSQL/SQL Server/Oracle, connection pooling, transaction management, migrations
**Testing**: JUnit/NUnit, integration testing, API testing, performance testing, security testing
**Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, enterprise CI/CD, monitoring, service mesh

## Agents and Roles
**Strategy**: product-manager, business-analyst
**Architecture**: enterprise-architect, software-architect, ux-designer
**Development**: backend-engineer, api-engineer, data-engineer
**Quality**: qa-engineer, security-engineer
**Operations**: deployment-engineer, database-administrator

## Integrations
**APIs**: Enterprise system integration, third-party APIs, legacy system connectivity, EDI
**Development**: Enterprise Git workflows, Maven/Gradle/NuGet, enterprise CI/CD pipelines
**Monitoring**: APM tools, enterprise logging, metrics collection, alerting, compliance reporting

## Requirements
**Performance**: <100ms response time, high throughput, connection pooling, caching strategies
**Security**: Enterprise authentication, authorization, encryption, audit trails, compliance
**Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, load balancing, database optimization, microservices architecture

## Framework Guidelines
**Constraints**: Enterprise standards, security policies, compliance requirements, integration patterns
**Style**: Enterprise architecture patterns, clean code principles, comprehensive documentation, monitoring
**Testing**: Enterprise testing standards, security testing, performance testing, compliance validation

## TODO Management
**Core**: Feature-based task organization with TodoWrite integration
**Levels**: Epic (product-manager) → Feature (enterprise-architect) → Service (api-engineer) → Testing (qa-engineer)
**Templates**:
- **Startup**: Simple hierarchy, session tracking
- **SME**: Full hierarchy, milestone tracking
- **Enterprise**: Complete system + external integration

## Project Ownership
**Team**: Enterprise development team with backend and integration expertise
**Interface**: Enterprise development standards with comprehensive governance and compliance
**Governance**: Code review, security audits, performance monitoring, compliance validation, architecture review

## Command-Agent Mapping
**Core Commands**: Session (save/restore/start), Project (health check/new/release), Business (analysis/requirements), Product (planning/MVP), Development (frontend/backend/API), Quality (tests/security), Architecture (design/deployment)
**Rules**: Polish/English support, context awareness, CLAUDE.md adaptation, TodoWrite integration
