**Goals**: Scalable enterprise architecture, maintainable codebase, excellent developer experience, performance optimization, accessibility compliance, production deployment.

## Technologies
**Frontend**: Angular 16+, TypeScript, RxJS, Angular CLI, Angular Material/PrimeNG, Angular Flex Layout
**Backend**: HTTP Client integration, REST/GraphQL API consumption
**Database**: Browser storage, API integration with backend databases
**Testing**: Jasmine, Karma, Protractor/Cypress (E2E), Angular Testing Utilities, Spectator
**Deployment**: Angular CLI, Webpack, ESLint, Prettier, Compodoc, CI/CD pipelines

## Agents and Roles
**Strategy**: product-manager, business-analyst
**Architecture**: software-architect, ux-designer
**Development**: frontend-engineer, api-engineer
**Quality**: qa-engineer, security-engineer
**Operations**: deployment-engineer

## Integrations
**APIs**: HTTP Client, Interceptors, Error handling, Authentication integration
**Development**: Angular CLI, Git workflow, npm/yarn, CI/CD pipelines
**Monitoring**: Angular Universal (SSR), Error tracking, Performance monitoring, Analytics

## Requirements
**Performance**: OnPush change detection, lazy loading, tree shaking, AOT compilation
**Security**: Authentication guards, secure HTTP communication, XSS protection
**Scalability**: Feature modules, shared modules, core module pattern, barrel exports

## Framework Guidelines
**Constraints**: Angular style guide, TypeScript strict mode, reactive programming patterns
**Style**: Component-based architecture, smart/dumb component pattern, consistent naming
**Testing**: Unit tests for components/services, integration tests, E2E tests for user flows

## TODO Management
**Core**: Feature-based task organization with TodoWrite integration
**Levels**: Epic (product-manager) → Feature Module (frontend-engineer) → Component (detailed implementation) → Testing (qa-engineer)
**Templates**:
- **Startup**: Simple hierarchy, session tracking
- **SME**: Full hierarchy, milestone tracking
- **Enterprise**: Complete system + external integration

## Project Ownership
**Team**: Frontend development team with Angular and TypeScript expertise
**Interface**: Enterprise Angular development with NgRx and comprehensive testing
**Governance**: Code review, performance monitoring, accessibility audits, module architecture

## Command-Agent Mapping
**Core Commands**: Session (save/restore/start), Project (health check/new/release), Business (analysis/requirements), Product (planning/MVP), Development (frontend/backend/API), Quality (tests/security), Architecture (design/deployment)
**Rules**: Polish/English support, context awareness, CLAUDE.md adaptation, TodoWrite integration
