## Project Overview
Full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application with TypeScript, featuring modern development practices, comprehensive testing, and scalable architecture. Optimized for rapid development and production deployment.

**Core Capabilities**: React frontend with TypeScript, Express.js REST API, MongoDB database, JWT authentication, real-time features, comprehensive testing, Docker deployment.

**Goals**: Rapid full-stack development, scalable architecture, maintainable codebase, excellent developer experience, production-ready deployment, modern development practices.

## Technologies
**Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Next.js (optional), Tailwind CSS/Material-UI, React Query, React Router
**Backend**: Node.js 18+, Express.js, TypeScript, Mongoose ODM, JWT authentication, bcrypt
**Database**: MongoDB, MongoDB Atlas, Redis (caching/sessions)
**Testing**: Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest, Cypress (E2E), MongoDB Memory Server
**Deployment**: Concurrently, nodemon, ESLint, Prettier, Husky, Docker, Docker Compose

## Agents and Roles
**Strategy**: product-manager, business-analyst
**Architecture**: software-architect, ux-designer
**Development**: frontend-engineer, backend-engineer, api-engineer, data-engineer
**Quality**: qa-engineer, security-engineer
**Operations**: deployment-engineer

## Integrations
**APIs**: RESTful API design, GraphQL (optional), third-party service integration
**Development**: Git workflow, npm workspaces, CI/CD pipelines, Docker development
**Monitoring**: Error tracking, performance monitoring, logging aggregation

## Requirements
**Performance**: Frontend <3s load, API <200ms response, database query optimization, caching
**Security**: Input validation, SQL injection prevention, authentication/authorization, CORS
**Scalability**: Horizontal scaling, stateless design, microservices architecture, load balancing

## Framework Guidelines
**Constraints**: TypeScript strict mode, React best practices, Express.js patterns, MongoDB schema design
**Style**: Component-based frontend, RESTful API design, modular backend architecture
**Testing**: Full-stack testing strategy, API integration tests, E2E user flows

## TODO Management
**Core**: Feature-based task organization with TodoWrite integration
**Levels**: Epic (product-manager) → Feature (full-stack) → Frontend Component + API Endpoint → Testing (qa-engineer)
**Templates**:
- **Startup**: Simple hierarchy, session tracking
- **SME**: Full hierarchy, milestone tracking
- **Enterprise**: Complete system + external integration

## Project Ownership
**Team**: Full-stack development team with MERN expertise
**Interface**: Integrated development environment with shared TypeScript types
**Governance**: Code review, API versioning, database schema evolution, performance monitoring

## Command-Agent Mapping
**Core Commands**: Session (save/restore/start), Project (health check/new/release), Business (analysis/requirements), Product (planning/MVP), Development (frontend/backend/API), Quality (tests/security), Architecture (design/deployment)
**Rules**: Polish/English support, context awareness, CLAUDE.md adaptation, TodoWrite integration
