```bash
# Copy template to active configuration
cp CLAUDE_template.md CLAUDE.md

# Edit with basic project information
nano CLAUDE.md  # or code CLAUDE.md
```

**Essential changes to make:**
```markdown
## Project Metadata
- **project_name**: "your-actual-project-name"
- **project_description**: "Brief description of your project"
- **primary_language**: "typescript"  # Change to your main language
- **business_domain**: "web_development"  # Change to your domain
- **project_scale**: "startup"  # startup, sme, or enterprise
```

#### **Option B: AI-Powered Generation (For Advanced Setup)**
```bash
# Use AI-powered CLAUDE.md generation
# See: claude-md-generation.md for detailed instructions

# Quick AI generation:
# 1. Use .claude/prompts/init/new-project.md prompt
# 2. AI analyzes your project and generates optimal configuration
# 3. Review and customize generated CLAUDE.md
```

### **Validate Configuration**
```bash
# Test configuration with AI Agent Selector
python ./.ai-tools/core/demo/demo_project_analyzer.py .

# Expected output:
# üéØ PROJECT ANALYSIS
# Technology Stack: [Your detected stack]
# Business Domain: [Your specified domain]
# Project Scale: [Your specified scale]
#
# ü§ñ RECOMMENDED AGENTS
# Primary: [agent-name] (confidence: 0.XX)
# Secondary: [agent-name] (confidence: 0.XX)
```

**If you see errors:**
```bash
# Common fixes:
# 1. Check Python dependencies
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

# 2. Verify CLAUDE.md format
grep -E "project_name|primary_language" CLAUDE.md

# 3. Run in fallback mode if needed
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.append('.')
print('Framework path OK')
"
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: CLAUDE.md configured and AI analysis working.

#### **Scenario: Adding User Authentication**
```bash
# Ask for agent recommendations for authentication feature
# This demonstrates core framework functionality
```

**Example interaction:**
```
You: "I want to add user authentication to my project. Which agents should I use and what approach do you recommend?"

Expected AI Response:
ü§ñ AGENT RECOMMENDATION ANALYSIS
Based on your project configuration:

Primary Agents:
- security-engineer (confidence: 0.94) - Authentication security patterns
- api-engineer (confidence: 0.91) - Backend authentication API
- frontend-engineer (confidence: 0.88) - Login/register UI components

Recommended Approach:
1. security-engineer: Design secure authentication architecture
2. api-engineer: Implement JWT-based authentication API
3. frontend-engineer: Create responsive authentication UI
4. qa-engineer: Develop comprehensive authentication tests
```

#### **Follow Through: Architecture Planning**
```bash
# Use the recommended security-engineer agent for authentication design
```

**Example follow-up:**
```
You: "Using security-engineer agent, design a secure authentication system for my [React/Node.js/Python/etc.] application."

Expected Response:
üîí AUTHENTICATION ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

Security Requirements:
- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
