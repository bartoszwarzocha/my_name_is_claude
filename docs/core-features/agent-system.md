## üîó Agent-Prompt Binding System

### Automatic Agent Activation

The framework implements revolutionary **directory-based agent binding**:

```
.claude/prompts/agents/[category]/ ‚Üí Activates corresponding agent
```

**Activation Examples:**
```bash
# API Development
.claude/prompts/agents/api/rest-api-design.md ‚Üí api-engineer

# Frontend Development
.claude/prompts/agents/frontend/react-component.md ‚Üí frontend-engineer

# Security Engineering
.claude/prompts/agents/security/threat-modeling.md ‚Üí security-engineer

# Business Analysis
.claude/prompts/agents/business/requirements-gathering.md ‚Üí business-analyst

# Quality Assurance
.claude/prompts/agents/quality/performance-testing.md ‚Üí qa-engineer
```

### Agent Activation Workflow

When any prompt from `.claude/prompts/agents/[category]/` is used:

1. **Automatic Agent Selection**
   - Framework detects prompt category from directory path
   - Activates corresponding agent automatically
   - No manual agent selection required

2. **Context Loading**
   - Agent reads CLAUDE.md configuration
   - Adapts competencies to project requirements
   - Configures TODO management integration

3. **Task Execution**
   - Agent applies specialized knowledge and patterns
   - Integrates with TodoWrite workflow system
   - Coordinates with other agents as needed

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Ensures enterprise-grade implementation
   - Validates against framework standards
   - Maintains consistency across agents

## üîÑ Multi-Agent Coordination

### Coordination Patterns

#### **Sequential Coordination**
Agents work in sequence with clear handoffs:

```yaml
Example: Feature Development
1. business-analyst ‚Üí Requirements gathering
2. software-architect ‚Üí Architecture design
3. frontend-engineer ‚Üí UI implementation
4. backend-engineer ‚Üí Business logic
5. qa-engineer ‚Üí Testing and validation
```

#### **Parallel Coordination**
Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent tasks:

```yaml
Example: Parallel Development
Simultaneously:
- frontend-engineer: UI components
- backend-engineer: API services
- data-engineer: Database schema
- security-engineer: Security review
```

#### **Hierarchical Coordination**
Agents coordinate across different TODO hierarchy levels:

```yaml
Example: Epic Coordination
Epic Level: business-analyst, product-manager
Feature Level: software-architect, ux-designer
Task Level: frontend-engineer, backend-engineer
Subtask Level: All agents for detailed execution
```

### Handoff Protocols

#### **Context Preservation**
- **State Transfer**: Complete context passed between agents
- **TODO Continuity**: Tasks seamlessly transferred with full context
- **Quality Validation**: Handoff quality validated before transfer
- **Documentation**: All handoffs documented for tracking

#### **Dependency Management**
- **Automatic Detection**: Framework identifies task dependencies
- **Conflict Resolution**: Prevents overlapping work between agents
- **Resource Coordination**: Manages shared resources and files
- **Timeline Coordination**: Aligns agent work with project timeline

## üéØ Agent Selection Intelligence

### AI-Powered Recommendations

The framework uses [AI-Powered Agent Selection](ai-agent-selection.md) to intelligently recommend agents:

#### **Technology-Based Selection**
```yaml
React Project:
  Primary: frontend-engineer (confidence: 0.92)
  Supporting: ux-designer (confidence: 0.85)

Node.js API Project:
  Primary: api-engineer (confidence: 0.90)
  Supporting: backend-engineer (confidence: 0.88)

Enterprise Project:
  Primary: enterprise-architect (confidence: 0.87)
  Supporting: security-engineer, compliance-auditor
```

#### **Business Domain Adaptation**
```yaml
FinTech Domain:
  Required: security-engineer, compliance-auditor
  Compliance: PCI-DSS, SOX validation

Healthcare Domain:
  Required: compliance-auditor, security-engineer
  Compliance: HIPAA, privacy protection

E-commerce Domain:
  Required: frontend-engineer, api-engineer
  Focus: User experience, payment processing
```

#### **Project Scale Adaptation**
```yaml
Startup Scale:
  Core Team: frontend-engineer, backend-engineer, qa-engineer

SME Scale:
  Extended Team: + software-architect, ux-designer
  Focus: Scalable architecture and user experience

Enterprise Scale:
  Full Team: + enterprise-architect, security-engineer, compliance-auditor
  Focus: Enterprise integration and compliance
```

## üîß Agent Configuration

### CLAUDE.md Integration

All agents automatically adapt based on CLAUDE.md configuration:

```yaml
# Agent behavior adapts to project configuration
primary_language: "typescript"     # Affects code examples and patterns
business_domain: "fintech"         # Affects compliance and security focus
project_scale: "enterprise"       # Affects complexity and governance
development_stage: "production"   # Affects quality and stability focus
```

### Agent Specialization Mapping

```yaml
Technology Stack ‚Üí Agent Specialization:
  React/Angular/Vue ‚Üí frontend-engineer (React patterns)
  Node.js/Express ‚Üí backend-engineer (JavaScript patterns)
  Python/FastAPI ‚Üí api-engineer (Python patterns)
  PostgreSQL/MongoDB ‚Üí data-engineer (Database patterns)
  Docker/Kubernetes ‚Üí deployment-engineer (Container patterns)

Business Domain ‚Üí Agent Focus:
  FinTech ‚Üí security-engineer (Financial compliance)
  Healthcare ‚Üí compliance-auditor (HIPAA compliance)
  E-commerce ‚Üí ux-designer (User experience focus)
  Enterprise ‚Üí enterprise-architect (Integration focus)
```

## üìã Agent Development Standards

  3. Role philosophy and principles
  4. Technology/business specializations
  5. Core competencies
  6. Domain-specific implementations
  7. Role-specific specializations
  8. Final adaptation reminder
```

#### **Quality Standards**
```yaml
CLAUDE.md Integration: Must read and adapt to project configuration
TodoWrite Integration: Must integrate with hierarchical TODO system
