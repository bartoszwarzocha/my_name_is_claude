### Hybrid Intelligence Algorithm

#### 1. Context Analysis
```python
def analyze_project_context(context):
    return {
        'technologies': extract_tech_stack(context),
        'domain': identify_business_domain(context),
        'complexity': assess_project_complexity(context),
        'project_phase': determine_current_phase(context),
        'constraints': identify_requirements(context)
    }
```

#### 2. Universal Pattern Matching
- **Technology Indicators**: Match detected technologies to proven agent patterns
- **Domain Rules**: Apply industry-specific best practices and requirements
- **Complexity Scaling**: Recommend appropriate agent count for project scale
- **Best Practice Integration**: Include proven architectural and process patterns

#### 3. Adaptive Learning Integration

- **Effectiveness Weighting**: Boost agents with proven success in project context
- **Context-Specific Adaptation**: Apply project-phase and task-type learning
- **Personalization Enhancement**: Tailor recommendations to user and team preferences

#### 4. Hybrid Combination
```python
def combine_recommendations(universal_recs, adaptive_recs, learning_quality):
    # Dynamic weight adjustment based on learning quality
    if learning_quality.alignment_rate > 0.75 and learning_quality.interactions > 10:
        universal_weight = 0.54  # Reduced as learning improves
        adaptive_weight = 0.52   # Increased for strong learning
    else:
        universal_weight = 0.6   # Standard weights for developing learning
        adaptive_weight = 0.4

    combined_scores = {}
    for agent in all_agents:
        score = (universal_scores[agent] * universal_weight +
                adaptive_scores[agent] * adaptive_weight)

        # Multi-source bonus
        if agent in universal_recs and agent in adaptive_recs:
            score *= 1.15  # 15% bonus for dual recommendation

        # Context-specific bonuses
        if is_domain_specialist(agent, context):
            score += 0.1  # Domain specialization bonus

        combined_scores[agent] = min(score, 1.0)

    return sorted(combined_scores.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
```

```python
from learning.hybrid_intelligence import HybridIntelligenceSystem

# Initialize hybrid system
hybrid = HybridIntelligenceSystem()

# Get hybrid recommendations
context = {
    'technologies': ['react', 'node.js', 'postgresql'],
    'domain': 'ecommerce',
    'complexity': 'medium',
    'project_phase': 'development',
    'has_frontend': True,

}

recommendations = hybrid.get_hybrid_recommendations(context)

# Process results
for rec in recommendations[:5]:
    print(f"{rec['agent']}: {rec['confidence']:.2f}")
    print(f"  Sources: {', '.join(rec['sources'])}")
    print(f"  Universal: {rec['universal_score']:.2f}")
    print(f"  Adaptive: {rec['adaptive_score']:.2f}")
    print(f"  Reasoning: {rec['reasoning']}")
```

### Feedback Integration

```python
# Record user feedback
hybrid.record_feedback(
    recommended_agents=['frontend-engineer', 'ux-designer', 'backend-engineer'],
    selected_agent='frontend-engineer',
    context={'task_type': 'development', 'project_phase': 'implementation'}
)

hybrid.record_task_outcome(
    agent_name='frontend-engineer',
    success=True,
    context={
        'task_type': 'development',
        'completion_time': 45.0,
        'quality_score': 0.9
    }
)
```

### System Monitoring

```python
# Get system status
status = hybrid.get_system_status()
print(f"Learning Enabled: {status['learning_enabled']}")
print(f"Universal Patterns: {status['universal_patterns']['patterns_count']}")
print(f"Learning Quality: {status['adaptive_learning']['learning_quality']}")

# Get insights and suggestions
insights = hybrid.get_insights_and_suggestions()
print(f"Recommendation Mode: {insights['system_performance']['recommendation_mode']}")
print(f"Learning Quality: {insights['system_performance']['learning_quality']}")

for suggestion in insights.get('suggestions', []):
    print(f"ðŸ’¡ {suggestion['type']}: {suggestion['message']}")
```

## Configuration

### Hybrid Intelligence Settings

```python
hybrid_config = {
    "universal_weight": 0.6,          # Base weight for universal patterns
    "adaptive_weight": 0.4,           # Base weight for adaptive learning
    "confidence_threshold": 0.5,      # Minimum confidence for recommendations
    "max_recommendations": 10,        # Maximum number of recommendations
    "learning_boost_factor": 1.2,     # Boost for effective agents
    "universal_decay_factor": 0.9,    # Reduce universal weight as learning improves
    "context_sensitivity": 0.8,       # Weight for context-specific adjustments
    "domain_specialization_bonus": 0.1, # Bonus for domain specialists
    "effectiveness_threshold": 0.7,   # Minimum success rate for bonuses
    "alignment_threshold": 0.75       # Alignment rate for weight adjustment
}
```

### Dynamic Weight Adjustment

The system automatically adjusts weights based on learning quality:

```python
def adjust_weights(total_choices, alignment_rate):
    if total_choices >= 10 and alignment_rate >= 0.75:
        # Strong learning - favor adaptive
        universal_weight = 0.6 * 0.9  # Decay factor
        adaptive_weight = 0.4 * 1.3   # Boost factor
    elif total_choices >= 5:
        # Moderate learning - balanced
        universal_weight = 0.6
        adaptive_weight = 0.4
    else:
        # Weak learning - favor universal
        universal_weight = 0.6 * 1.2
        adaptive_weight = 0.4 * 0.7

    # Normalize weights
    total = universal_weight + adaptive_weight
    return universal_weight / total, adaptive_weight / total
```
