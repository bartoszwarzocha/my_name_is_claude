## 🎯 Crisis Response Workflows

### **Workflow 1: Production Outage Response**

#### **Phase 1: Immediate Response (0-5 minutes)**
```bash
# Incident detection and initial triage
Monitoring_Engineer: "Production outage detected - activating crisis response protocol"

# Agent activation sequence:
# 1. incident-responder: Crisis coordination and communication
# 2. sre-engineer: System health assessment and immediate mitigation
# 3. monitoring-engineer: Enhanced monitoring and alerting
```

**Immediate Actions Checklist:**
```yaml
Crisis Coordination:
  - Activate incident commander role
  - Establish communication channels
  - Notify stakeholders and customers
  - Document incident start time

Technical Assessment:
  - Check system health dashboards
  - Verify monitoring and alerting systems
  - Assess scope and impact
  - Identify affected services and users

Initial Mitigation:
  - Execute automated rollback procedures
  - Activate failover systems if available
  - Implement temporary workarounds
  - Scale resources if capacity-related
```

#### **Phase 2: Investigation and Diagnosis (5-30 minutes)**
```bash
# Deep technical investigation
SRE_Engineer: "Analyzing system logs and metrics to identify root cause"
Security_Engineer: "Investigating potential security implications"
Performance_Engineer: "Assessing performance impact and bottlenecks"

# Investigation workflow:
# 1. Log analysis and error pattern identification
# 2. System metrics review and anomaly detection
# 3. Recent deployment and configuration change review
# 4. Infrastructure and dependency health check
```

**Investigation Framework:**
```yaml
Technical Analysis:
  - Review recent deployments and changes
  - Analyze error logs and stack traces
  - Check database performance and connections
  - Verify third-party service dependencies
  - Assess infrastructure and network status

Impact Assessment:
  - Quantify affected users and transactions
  - Measure revenue and business impact
  - Identify affected geographical regions
  - Assess data integrity and security implications

Root Cause Identification:
  - Trace error propagation through system
  - Identify primary and contributing factors
  - Document timeline of events and changes
  - Verify hypothesis through testing
```

#### **Phase 3: Resolution and Recovery (30 minutes - 2 hours)**
```bash
# Coordinated resolution implementation
Deployment_Engineer: "Implementing fix deployment with zero-downtime strategy"
Reliability_Engineer: "Orchestrating system recovery and validation"
Data_Engineer: "Verifying data integrity and consistency"

# Recovery coordination:
# 1. Fix development and testing
# 2. Staged deployment with monitoring
# 3. System health validation
# 4. User communication and status updates
```

**Resolution Process:**
```yaml
Fix Development:
  - Develop targeted fix for root cause
  - Test fix in staging environment
  - Prepare rollback procedures
  - Document implementation steps

Deployment Strategy:
  - Coordinate with incident commander
  - Implement gradual rollout if possible
  - Monitor system health during deployment
  - Validate fix effectiveness

Recovery Validation:
  - Verify all systems operational
  - Confirm user access and functionality
  - Check data integrity and consistency
  - Monitor for regression issues
```

### **Workflow 2: Security Incident Response**

#### **Phase 1: Containment (0-15 minutes)**
```bash
# Security incident containment
Security_Engineer: "Security breach detected - initiating containment procedures"
Incident_Responder: "Coordinating security response and stakeholder communication"

# Immediate containment actions:
# 1. Isolate affected systems and networks
# 2. Preserve evidence and forensic data
# 3. Assess breach scope and impact
# 4. Implement emergency access controls
```

#### **Phase 2: Investigation (15 minutes - 4 hours)**
```bash
# Forensic analysis and investigation
"Conduct thorough security investigation to understand attack vector and impact"
"Analyze logs and evidence to determine extent of compromise"
"Coordinate with legal and compliance teams for regulatory requirements"
```

#### **Phase 3: Eradication and Recovery (4-24 hours)**
```bash
# Security remediation and system hardening
"Remove malicious code and close security vulnerabilities"
"Implement enhanced security measures and monitoring"
"Restore systems from clean backups with security validation"
```

### **Workflow 3: Data Loss or Corruption Crisis**

#### **Emergency Data Recovery Protocol:**
```bash
# Data crisis response
Data_Engineer: "Data corruption detected - activating recovery procedures"
Reliability_Engineer: "Coordinating backup restoration and validation"

# Recovery sequence:
# 1. Stop write operations to prevent further corruption
# 2. Assess corruption scope and identify clean backup points
# 3. Execute recovery from most recent clean backup
# 4. Validate data integrity and consistency
# 5. Resume operations with enhanced monitoring
```
