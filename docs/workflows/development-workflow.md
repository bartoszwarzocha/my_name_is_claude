## ðŸ”„ Agent Coordination Patterns

### **Sequential Workflow Pattern**
*Agents work in planned sequence with clear handoffs*

```yaml
1. business-analyst: Requirements and stakeholder analysis
   â†“ (handoff: requirements document)
2. software-architect: Technical architecture and design
   â†“ (handoff: architecture specifications)
3. frontend-engineer + api-engineer: Parallel implementation
   â†“ (handoff: implemented features)
4. qa-engineer: Quality validation and testing
   â†“ (handoff: validated features)
5. deployment-engineer: Production deployment
   â†“ (handoff: deployed system)
6. monitoring-engineer: Production monitoring setup
```

### **Parallel Workflow Pattern**
*Multiple agents work simultaneously on independent tasks*

```yaml
Architecture Phase:

â”œâ”€ api-engineer: Backend services and API endpoints
â”œâ”€ data-engineer: Database implementation and optimization
â””â”€ qa-engineer: Test development and validation setup
```

### **Review and Validation Pattern**
*Cross-functional review at key milestones*

```yaml
Feature Milestone Reviews:

- Architecture Review: software-architect + security-engineer + performance-engineer
- Implementation Review: All development agents + qa-engineer
- Security Review: security-engineer + compliance auditor (if applicable)
