**Documentation Type:** Architectural Diagrams and System Design
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-17
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## Overview

This section contains comprehensive architectural documentation for the Claude Code Multi-Agent Framework, including PlantUML diagrams, system design patterns, and workflow visualizations that illustrate the framework's internal structure and coordination mechanisms.

## Architectural Diagrams

### üîÑ **Development Lifecycle Workflows**
- **[agent-sdlc-workflow.puml](agent-sdlc-workflow.puml)** - Original software development lifecycle with multi-agent coordination
- **[agent-sdlc-v2-workflow.puml](agent-sdlc-v2-workflow.puml)** - Enhanced SDLC workflow with advanced agent specialization and quality gates

### üìã **Task Management Architecture**
- **[hierarchical-todo-management.puml](hierarchical-todo-management.puml)** - Enterprise-grade hierarchical TODO system architecture (Epic ‚Üí Feature ‚Üí Task ‚Üí Subtask)
- **[simple-todowrite-workflow.puml](simple-todowrite-workflow.puml)** - Streamlined TodoWrite workflow for rapid development and small teams

## Architecture Principles

### üèóÔ∏è **Multi-Agent System Design**
The framework implements a sophisticated multi-agent architecture based on:
- **Agent Specialization** - Each agent has clearly defined competencies and responsibilities
- **Coordination Protocols** - Structured handoff mechanisms between agents
- **Quality Gates** - Built-in validation checkpoints throughout development lifecycle
- **Hierarchical Task Management** - TodoWrite integration for enterprise-grade task coordination

### üîÑ **Workflow Orchestration**
The architecture supports multiple workflow patterns:
- **Linear Workflows** - Sequential agent activation for simple projects
- **Parallel Workflows** - Concurrent agent execution for complex projects
- **Quality-Gated Workflows** - Validation checkpoints between development phases
- **Adaptive Workflows** - Dynamic workflow adjustment based on project characteristics

### üìä **System Integration**
Framework architecture integrates with:
- **MCP Tools** - Serena, Context7, Playwright for enhanced capabilities
- **AI Systems** - Machine learning-based agent selection and recommendations
- **External Tools** - Git, CI/CD systems, monitoring platforms
- **Development Environments** - IDEs, testing frameworks, deployment systems

## Using Architecture Diagrams

### For Developers
1. **System Understanding** - Study workflow diagrams to understand agent coordination
2. **Integration Planning** - Use architecture patterns for system integration
3. **Workflow Design** - Adapt workflow patterns to project requirements
4. **Quality Implementation** - Follow quality gate patterns for robust development

### For Enterprise Teams
1. **Architecture Review** - Present system architecture to stakeholders
2. **Compliance Planning** - Use TODO hierarchy for audit trail requirements
3. **Team Coordination** - Implement multi-agent patterns for team workflows
4. **Process Optimization** - Optimize development processes using workflow patterns

### for Technical Documentation
1. **PlantUML Source** - All diagrams provided in editable PlantUML format
2. **Version Control** - Diagrams tracked in git for change management
3. **Customization** - Adapt diagrams for organization-specific requirements
4. **Integration** - Include diagrams in project documentation and presentations
