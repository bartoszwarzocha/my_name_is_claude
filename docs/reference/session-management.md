## 🔧 Session Management Workflow

### Session Start Process

1. **Context Detection**
   ```yaml
   Framework analyzes:
     - Project structure and technology stack
     - CLAUDE.md configuration and requirements
     - Available MCP tools (.serena directory)
     - Previous session summaries
     - Git repository state and recent changes
   ```

2. **Agent Activation**
   ```yaml
   Based on analysis:
     - Recommends appropriate agents via AI Agent Selection
     - Activates session-manager for coordination
     - Loads agent competencies and specializations
     - Configures TODO management based on project scale
   ```

3. **Context Establishment**
   ```yaml
   Session initialization:
     - Loads project context and requirements
     - Establishes TODO hierarchy and tracking
     - Configures agent coordination patterns
     - Sets up progress monitoring and reporting
   ```

### Session Continuation Process

1. **State Recovery**
   ```yaml
   Automatic restoration:
     - Loads previous session summary
     - Restores agent states and configurations
     - Recovers TODO progress and dependencies
     - Validates context integrity
   ```

2. **Context Validation**
   ```yaml
   Integrity checks:
     - Verifies project configuration unchanged
     - Checks for new files or dependencies
     - Validates agent competency alignment
     - Confirms TODO hierarchy consistency
   ```

3. **Seamless Resume**
   ```yaml
   Work continuation:
     - Activates appropriate agents
     - Restores work context and progress
     - Continues TODO workflow where left off
     - Maintains team coordination and handoffs
   ```

### Session End Process

1. **State Summarization**
   ```yaml
   Comprehensive summary:
     - Work completed in session
     - TODO progress and updates
     - Agent interactions and handoffs
     - Context changes and discoveries
   ```

2. **Context Preservation**
   ```yaml
   State saving:
     - Current agent configurations
     - TODO hierarchy and progress
     - Project context and requirements
     - Team coordination status
   ```

3. **Integration Updates**
   ```yaml
   External tool sync:
     - Serena index updates (if available)
     - Git state and change tracking
     - External project management tools
     - Team collaboration platforms
   ```

## 🔗 Serena MCP Integration

### Automatic Detection

Framework automatically detects Serena MCP availability:

```bash
# Detection logic
if [[ -d ".serena" ]]; then
    SERENA_AVAILABLE=true
    ENHANCED_CONTEXT=true
else
    SERENA_AVAILABLE=false
    FALLBACK_MODE=true
fi
```

### Enhanced Session Capabilities

When Serena MCP is active:

#### **Project Knowledge Base**
```yaml
Serena provides:
  - Semantic code analysis and understanding
  - Intelligent project structure navigation
  - Historical pattern recognition
  - Context-aware code recommendations
  - Dependency analysis and mapping
```

#### **Session Memory Strategy**
```yaml
Hybrid approach:
  Primary: Serena's indexed project knowledge
  Secondary: Framework's session summaries
  Combined: Comprehensive context understanding
```

#### **Index Synchronization**
```yaml
Automatic triggers:
  - After significant project changes
  - When new files or dependencies added
  - During session start/end processes
  - On explicit user request (serena sync)
```

### Serena Integration Examples

#### Session Start with Serena
```bash
User: "rozpocznij sesję"

Framework actions:
1. Detects .serena directory → SERENA_AVAILABLE=true
2. Loads Serena project index → Enhanced context

4. Activates session-manager with Serena integration
5. Provides enhanced agent recommendations
```

#### Context Analysis with Serena
```bash
User: "analiza kontekstu"

Framework provides:
1. Serena semantic analysis → Code patterns and architecture
2. CLAUDE.md configuration → Project requirements
3. Git repository state → Recent changes and activity
4. TODO hierarchy → Current progress and priorities
5. Combined intelligence → Comprehensive project understanding
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Session Issues

#### 1. Session Not Starting
```yaml
Symptoms:
  - Framework doesn't recognize project
  - No agent recommendations provided
  - Context analysis fails

Solutions:
  - Verify CLAUDE.md exists and is valid
  - Check project structure and technology stack
  - Ensure proper directory permissions
  - Validate framework installation
```

#### 2. Context Recovery Failure
```yaml
Symptoms:
  - Previous work context not restored
  - TODO progress lost
  - Agent configurations reset

Solutions:
  - Check session summary files in project_archive/research/
  - Verify .gitignore excludes temporary session files
  - Manually restore from SESSION_SUMMARY_CURRENT.md
  - Rebuild context from project analysis
```

#### 3. Serena Integration Issues
```yaml
Symptoms:
  - Serena commands not working
  - Index updates failing
  - Enhanced context not available

Solutions:
  - Verify .serena directory exists and is accessible
  - Check Serena MCP tool installation
  - Restart Claude Code with MCP tools enabled
  - Fallback to standard session management
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Projects
```yaml
Optimizations:
  - Limit context depth: focused instead of comprehensive
  - Reduce TODO granularity: standard instead of detailed
  - Selective agent activation: only required agents
  - Batch Serena updates: periodic instead of real-time
```

#### For Distributed Teams
```yaml
Settings:
  - Enable session sharing and synchronization
  - Use centralized session storage
  - Configure team handoff protocols
  - Set up automated session backup
```
