- **Task Context** - Maps commands to appropriate complexity level of prompts
- **User Preference** - Adapts to user's preferred communication style
- **MCP Tools Detection** - Automatically enhances commands when Serena MCP is active

### Fuzzy Matching

- **Partial Commands** - Recognizes incomplete or abbreviated commands
- **Synonyms** - Handles multiple ways of expressing the same intent
- **Technical Variations** - Maps technical variations to standard commands
- **Intent Recognition** - Understands user intent with non-standard phrasing

### Multi-Command Handling

- **Compound Commands** - Processes multiple commands in single request
- **Sequential Processing** - Executes complex workflows with multiple agents
- **Dependency Resolution** - Understands command dependencies and execution order
- **Batch Operations** - Groups related commands for efficient execution

## üîß Advanced Command Features

### Automatic Agent Coordination

```bash
# Example: Complex workflow commands
"full project setup"        # Activates project-owner ‚Üí business-analyst ‚Üí software-architect
"security audit"            # Activates security-engineer ‚Üí compliance-auditor ‚Üí reviewer
"performance optimization"  # Activates performance-engineer ‚Üí qa-engineer ‚Üí monitoring-engineer
```

### Context-Sensitive Recommendations

The framework provides intelligent command suggestions based on:
- Current project state and configuration
- Previous command history and patterns
- Detected technology stack and requirements
- Active session context and ongoing work

### Error Handling and Recovery

- **Command Not Recognized** - Provides similar command suggestions
- **Missing Context** - Requests necessary context for command execution
- **Agent Unavailable** - Suggests alternative agents or approaches
- **Integration Failure** - Provides fallback commands and recovery options
