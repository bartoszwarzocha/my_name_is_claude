# Agent Overview - My Name Is Claude

**Status:** Production Ready ‚úÖ

Comprehensive overview of the Claude Code Multi-Agent Framework's AI agent ecosystem covering complete enterprise development lifecycle.

## üéØ Agent System Overview

The My Name Is Claude provides a sophisticated ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each representing over a decade of expert-level experience in their domain. The agent system enables intelligent automation across the complete software development lifecycle.

## üèóÔ∏è Agent Architecture

### Three-Tier Agent Organization

#### **Core Agents (Essential Development)**
Essential agents for basic development workflows, project management, and fundamental software engineering tasks.

#### **Enterprise Agents (Advanced Operations)**
Advanced agents for enterprise-scale operations, specialized governance, compliance, and complex technical domains.

#### **Custom Agents (Specialized Technologies)**
Specialized agents for specific technology stacks, domain expertise, and advanced technical specializations.

## üîó Automatic Agent Activation

### Revolutionary Agent-Prompt Binding

The framework implements intelligent directory-based agent activation:

```
.claude/prompts/agents/[category]/ ‚Üí Automatically activates corresponding agent
```

**Examples:**
- API development prompt ‚Üí Activates `api-engineer` agent
- Frontend component prompt ‚Üí Activates `frontend-engineer` agent
- Security analysis prompt ‚Üí Activates `security-engineer` agent
- Business requirements prompt ‚Üí Activates `business-analyst` agent

### Agent Activation Workflow

1. **Prompt Detection** - Framework identifies prompt category from directory structure
2. **Agent Selection** - Corresponding agent automatically activates
3. **Context Loading** - Agent reads CLAUDE.md configuration and adapts
4. **Specialization** - Agent applies domain expertise and project-specific patterns
5. **Integration** - Agent coordinates with TodoWrite workflow and other agents

## üéØ Intelligent Agent Selection

### AI-Powered Recommendations

The framework uses machine learning models to recommend optimal agents based on:

#### **Technology Stack Analysis**
```yaml
React Project Detection:
  Primary: frontend-engineer (confidence: 0.92)
  Supporting: ux-designer (confidence: 0.85)
  Coordination: api-engineer (confidence: 0.78)

Node.js API Project:
  Primary: api-engineer (confidence: 0.90)
  Supporting: backend-engineer (confidence: 0.88)
  Security: security-engineer (confidence: 0.82)
```

#### **Business Domain Adaptation**
```yaml
FinTech Domain:
  Required: security-engineer, compliance-auditor
  Focus: PCI-DSS compliance, financial security
  Specialized: risk-manager, governance-architect

Healthcare Domain:
  Required: compliance-auditor, security-engineer

Parallel Execution:
- frontend-engineer: UI components and user experience
- backend-engineer: Business logic and API development
- data-engineer: Database schema and data pipelines
- security-engineer: Security review and threat modeling
```

#### **Hierarchical Coordination**
Agents coordinate across different organizational levels:
```yaml
Enterprise Coordination:
Epic Level: business-analyst, enterprise-architect
Feature Level: software-architect, ux-designer
Task Level: frontend-engineer, backend-engineer, api-engineer
Validation Level: qa-engineer, security-engineer, reviewer
```
