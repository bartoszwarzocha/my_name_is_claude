# TODO Management - My Name Is Claude

**Status:** Production Ready ✅

Revolutionary hierarchical TODO management system with TodoWrite integration and multi-agent coordination for enterprise-grade project orchestration.

## 🎯 Overview

The My Name Is Claude includes a sophisticated hierarchical TODO management system that transforms traditional task tracking into intelligent, multi-agent coordinated workflows:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Epic → Feature → Task → Subtask
- **TodoWrite Integration**: Native integration with Claude Code's TodoWrite tool
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Seamless handoffs between specialized agents
- **Scale Adaptation**: Configurations for Startup, SME, and Enterprise projects
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Live progress monitoring and dependency management

## 🏗️ Hierarchical Structure

### 4-Level Task Hierarchy

```

## 🔄 TodoWrite Integration

### Automatic Task Creation

When agents work on projects with TODO management enabled:

1. **Agent Activation** → Reads CLAUDE.md Section 8 configuration
2. **Task Assessment** → Determines appropriate hierarchy level
3. **Automatic Creation** → Creates TODOs at correct level
4. **Coordination** → Links with related tasks and dependencies

### Task States

```yaml
States:
  pending: Task not yet started
  in_progress: Currently being worked on (limit: one per agent)
  completed: Task finished successfully
  blocked: Waiting for dependency or external input
  cancelled: Task no longer needed
```

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Real-Time Monitoring

```yaml
Epic Progress: "Implement shopping cart functionality"
  Overall: 65% complete

  Feature: "Cart item management" (80% complete)
    ✅ Create cart component UI (completed)
    ✅ Implement add/remove logic (completed)
    🔄 Add quantity controls (in_progress - frontend-engineer)
    ⏳ Create cart state management (pending)

  Feature: "Price calculation engine" (45% complete)
    ✅ Design calculation logic (completed)
    🔄 Implement tax calculations (in_progress - backend-engineer)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. TODO Tasks Not Creating Automatically
```yaml
Check:
  - CLAUDE.md Section 8: todo_management_enabled: true
  - Agent prompt includes TodoWrite integration
  - auto_task_creation: true in configuration

Fix:
  - Verify CLAUDE.md configuration
  - Restart agent with updated configuration
  - Check for syntax errors in CLAUDE.md
```

#### 2. Agent Handoffs Not Working
```yaml
Check:
  - agent_coordination: true in CLAUDE.md
  - task_handoffs: true in configuration
  - Agents have proper ownership assignments

Fix:
  - Review agent responsibility matrix
  - Verify task ownership configuration
  - Check cross-agent communication logs
```

#### 3. Hierarchy Levels Not Recognized
```yaml
Check:
  - todo_hierarchy_level: hierarchical in CLAUDE.md
  - epic_management: true for Epic support
  - feature_breakdown: true for Feature support

Fix:
  - Update hierarchy configuration
  - Restart framework with new settings
  - Migrate existing flat TODOs to hierarchy
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Large Projects
```yaml
Optimizations:
  - Enable subtask_tracking: false for large task lists
  - Use task_granularity: standard instead of detailed
  - Set progress_tracking: project instead of enterprise
  - Limit concurrent in_progress tasks per agent
```

#### For Distributed Teams
```yaml
Settings:
  - Enable external_tools integration
  - Use daily_standups: true for coordination
  - Set sync_frequency: "real-time" for active projects
  - Enable api_integration for custom tooling
```
