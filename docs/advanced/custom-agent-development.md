2. **Poor Integration** - Agents that don't work well with framework
3. **Outdated Knowledge** - Agents with outdated domain knowledge
4. **Hardcoded Assumptions** - Agents that don't adapt to different projects
5. **Poor Documentation** - Insufficient guidance for users
6. **No Validation** - Agents without quality validation mechanisms
7. **Static Behavior** - Agents that don't learn or improve over time
