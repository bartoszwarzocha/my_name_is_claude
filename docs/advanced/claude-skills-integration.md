## Overview

### What are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are a plugin ecosystem for the Claude API that allows you to extend Claude's capabilities with custom knowledge and specialized agents. Skills are organized as directory structures containing markdown files with agent definitions and configurations.

### Framework Integration

The "My Name Is Claude" framework provides **45 specialized agents** converted into **8 Claude Skills** using a **Hybrid Layered architecture** optimized for the Claude API's constraints (8-skill limit per request, 8MB per skill).

### Key Features

- ✅ **Production Ready**: 8 skills validated against Claude API requirements
- ✅ **Complete Coverage**: 30/32 agents converted (93.8% coverage)
- ✅ **Size Optimized**: Using only 3.5% of 8MB capacity (0.28MB total)
- ✅ **Framework Integration**: Preserves TodoWrite, Extended Thinking, CLAUDE.md adaptation, MCP tools
- ✅ **Automated Conversion**: Python converter with dependency mapping
- ✅ **Scalable Design**: Supports multi-skill loading for complex workflows

---

## Architecture

### Hybrid Layered Skills Architecture

The framework uses a **1 Foundation + 7 Domain Skills** architecture:

```
Foundation Skill (Always Load)
  ├── session-manager (orchestration)
  ├── product-manager (strategy)
  └── business-analyst (requirements)

Domain Skills (Load on Demand)
  ├── Architecture Skill
  │   └── software-architect
  ├── Development Skill
  │   ├── frontend-engineer
  │   ├── backend-engineer
  │   └── api-engineer
  ├── Data Skill
  │   ├── data-engineer
  │   └── data-scientist
  ├── Quality Skill
  │   ├── qa-engineer
  │   ├── performance-engineer
  │   └── reviewer
  ├── Security Skill
  │   ├── security-engineer
  │   ├── compliance-auditor
  │   └── governance-architect
  ├── Operations Skill
  │   ├── deployment-engineer
  │   ├── devops-architect
  │   ├── reliability-engineer
  │   ├── sre-engineer
  │   ├── monitoring-engineer
  │   ├── incident-responder
  │   └── capacity-planner
  └── Custom Skill
      ├── graphics-3d-engineer
      ├── graphics-2d-engineer
      ├── math-specialist
      ├── embedded-engineer
      ├── electronics-engineer
      ├── desktop-specialist
      ├── cad-engineer
      ├── 3d-addon-developer
      └── scientific-computing-specialist
```

### Why This Architecture?

1. **Foundation Always Loaded**: Ensures orchestration and coordination capabilities are always available
2. **Domain Organization**: Intuitive grouping matches typical development workflows
3. **8-Skill Limit Compliance**: All workflows fit within Claude API's 8-skill constraint
4. **On-Demand Loading**: Load only the domain skills needed for specific tasks
5. **Scalability**: Can easily add agents to existing skills without hitting size limits

---

## Skill Organization

### Skill Details

| Skill | Agents | Size | Capacity Used | Typical Workflows |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Foundation** | 3 | 0.03MB | 0.3% | All multi-agent workflows (always load) |
| **Architecture** | 1 | 0.01MB | 0.2% | System design, architecture review |
| **Development** | 3 | 0.03MB | 0.3% | Web development, API development |
| **Data** | 2 | 0.02MB | 0.2% | Data engineering, data science, analytics |
| **Quality** | 3 | 0.03MB | 0.3% | Testing, QA, performance optimization |
| **Security** | 3 | 0.03MB | 0.3% | Security audit, compliance, governance |
| **Operations** | 7 | 0.06MB | 0.8% | Deployment, DevOps, SRE, monitoring |
| **Custom** | 8 | 0.07MB | 0.9% | Specialized tech stacks (graphics, embedded, scientific) |

**Total**: 30 agents, 0.28MB (3.5% of 8MB limit)

### Skill Loading Strategy

**For Web Development Project:**
- Foundation + Development + Quality + Operations = 4 skills

**For Data Engineering Project:**
- Foundation + Data + Operations = 3 skills

**For Graphics Application:**
- Foundation + Custom + Development = 3 skills

**For Enterprise Security Audit:**
- Foundation + Security + Operations + Quality = 4 skills

## Using the Converter

### Converter Script

Location: `work/agent-to-skill-converter.py`

The converter automatically transforms agent markdown files into Claude Skills format with proper YAML frontmatter and directory structure.

### Running the Converter

```bash
python3 work/agent-to-skill-converter.py
```

### Converter Features

- **Automatic Agent Discovery**: Reads agents from `.claude/agents/` directory
- **Dependency Mapping**: Preserves cross-agent collaboration patterns
- **YAML Generation**: Creates proper SKILL.md files with frontmatter
- **Structure Validation**: Ensures Claude API compliance
- **Size Optimization**: Efficient structure minimizes size
- **Integration Preservation**: Keeps TodoWrite, Extended Thinking, CLAUDE.md references intact

### Converter Output

Generated skills are stored in `work/skills-output/`:

```
work/skills-output/
├── foundation/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── agents/
│       ├── session-manager.md
│       ├── product-manager.md
│       └── business-analyst.md
├── architecture/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── agents/
│       └── software-architect.md
├── development/
│   ├── SKILL.md
│   └── agents/
│       ├── frontend-engineer.md
│       ├── backend-engineer.md
│       └── api-engineer.md
... (5 more skills)
```

### Structure Validation

After conversion, validate skills:

```bash
python3 work/validate-skill-structure.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Total Skills: 8
✅ Valid: 8
❌ Invalid: 0

🎉 ALL SKILLS VALID - Ready for API Upload
```

## API Upload

### Prerequisites

1. Install Anthropic Python SDK:
```bash
pip install anthropic
```

2. Set API key:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Upload Foundation Skill

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
from anthropic.lib import files_from_dir

client = Anthropic()

# Upload Foundation skill (always load this first)
foundation_skill = client.beta.skills.create(
    display_title='My Name Is Claude - Foundation',
    files=files_from_dir('work/skills-output/foundation'),
    betas=['skills-2025-10-02']
)

print(f'Foundation Skill ID: {foundation_skill.id}')
```

### Upload Domain Skills

```python
# Upload Development skill
development_skill = client.beta.skills.create(
    display_title='My Name Is Claude - Development',
    files=files_from_dir('work/skills-output/development'),
    betas=['skills-2025-10-02']
)

print(f'Development Skill ID: {development_skill.id}')

# Repeat for other skills as needed
```

### Complete Upload Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Complete Skills Upload Script
Uploads all 8 skills to Claude API
"""

from anthropic import Anthropic
from anthropic.lib import files_from_dir

def upload_all_skills():
    client = Anthropic()

    skills_to_upload = [
        ('foundation', 'My Name Is Claude - Foundation'),
        ('architecture', 'My Name Is Claude - Architecture'),
        ('development', 'My Name Is Claude - Development'),
        ('data', 'My Name Is Claude - Data'),
        ('quality', 'My Name Is Claude - Quality'),
        ('security', 'My Name Is Claude - Security'),
        ('operations', 'My Name Is Claude - Operations'),
        ('custom', 'My Name Is Claude - Custom'),
    ]

    skill_ids = {}

    for skill_dir, display_title in skills_to_upload:
        print(f'Uploading {skill_dir}...')

        skill = client.beta.skills.create(
            display_title=display_title,
            files=files_from_dir(f'work/skills-output/{skill_dir}'),
            betas=['skills-2025-10-02']
        )

        skill_ids[skill_dir] = skill.id
        print(f'✅ {skill_dir}: {skill.id}')

    # Save skill IDs for reference
    import json
    with open('work/uploaded-skill-ids.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(skill_ids, f, indent=2)

    print('\n✅ All skills uploaded successfully!')
    print(f'Skill IDs saved to work/uploaded-skill-ids.json')

    return skill_ids

if __name__ == '__main__':
    upload_all_skills()
```

---

## Multi-Skill Loading

### Using Skills with Claude API

Once uploaded, specify skills when creating messages:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

# Example: Web development with Foundation + Development + Quality
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    max_tokens=4096,
    skills=[
        foundation_skill.id,  # Always include
        development_skill.id,
        quality_skill.id
    ],
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Please review this React component for quality and suggest improvements"
        }
    ],
    betas=['skills-2025-10-02']
)

print(message.content[0].text)
```

### Workflow Examples

**Full-Stack Web Development:**
```python
skills=[foundation_id, development_id, quality_id, operations_id]
```

**Data Engineering Pipeline:**
```python
skills=[foundation_id, data_id, operations_id]
```

**Security Audit:**
```python
skills=[foundation_id, security_id, quality_id]
```

**Graphics Application:**
```python
skills=[foundation_id, custom_id, development_id]
```

## Best Practices

### Skill Loading

1. **Always Load Foundation**: Foundation skill provides orchestration essential for multi-agent coordination
2. **Load Relevant Domains**: Only load skills needed for the current workflow
3. **Stay Under 8-Skill Limit**: Most workflows need 3-4 skills maximum
4. **Consider Dependencies**: Check `.claude/config/skills-dependency-mapping.json` for collaboration patterns

### Agent Selection

1. **Use Foundation Agents for Orchestration**: session-manager coordinates multi-agent workflows
2. **Combine Complementary Agents**: Frontend + Backend + API for full-stack development
3. **Quality Integration**: Always include quality agents for production code
4. **Security for Sensitive Projects**: Load security skill for compliance-critical work

### Performance Optimization

1. **Minimize Skill Count**: Fewer skills = faster loading
2. **Reuse Skills Across Sessions**: Skills persist between API calls
3. **Update Skills Periodically**: Re-upload when agents are updated
4. **Monitor Size**: Keep skills well under 8MB limit for future growth

### Development Workflow

1. **Test Locally First**: Validate skills with `validate-skill-structure.py` before upload
2. **Version Control**: Track skill IDs in version control
3. **Update Documentation**: Keep `.claude/config/skills-dependency-mapping.json` current
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Add agents incrementally, test thoroughly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Skill exceeds 8MB limit"
**Solution**:
- Check with `validate-skill-structure.py`
- Remove unnecessary content from agent files
- Split into multiple skills if needed

**Issue**: "Invalid YAML frontmatter"
**Solution**:
- Ensure colons in descriptions are quoted: `description: "text: with colon"`
- Validate YAML syntax before upload
- Run converter again to fix formatting

**Issue**: "Agent not found during conversion"
**Solution**:
- Check agent path in `.claude/config/skills-conversion-mapping.json`
- Verify agent file exists at specified path
- Run converter with verbose mode for debugging

**Issue**: "Skills not loading in Claude API"
**Solution**:
- Verify API key is set correctly
- Check beta flag: `betas=['skills-2025-10-02']`
- Ensure skill IDs are correct
- Verify skills were uploaded successfully

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Validate skill structure
python3 work/validate-skill-structure.py

# Check agent files exist
find .claude/agents/ -name "*.md" | wc -l  # Should be 45

# Verify skills output
ls -lh work/skills-output/*/SKILL.md  # Should show 8 files

# Check total size
du -sh work/skills-output/  # Should be < 1MB
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in converter:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
